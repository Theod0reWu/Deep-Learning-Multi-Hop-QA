Participants from every state were included and emphasis was placed upon getting input from female historians and ""specialists in African American studies"" as well as a few non-American historians. The study organizers noted a drop in recent Republican presidents\' scores by speculating that respondents put more weight towards a president\'s fealty towards political and institutional norms. 2018 Quinnipiac poll\nA Quinnipiac University poll taken March 3–5, 2018, asked 1,122 American voters who they believed were the best and worst presidents since World War II. 2014 Quinnipiac poll\nA Quinnipiac University poll taken June 24–30, 2014, asked 1,446 American registered voters who they believed were the best and worst presidents since World War II. 2017 Quinnipiac poll\nFour years later, a Quinnipiac University poll taken January 20–25, 2017, asked 1,190 American voters who they believed were the best and worst presidents since World War II.

Popular-opinion polls typically focus on recent or well-known presidents. 69–70 rated all recent presidents, from FDR on. The worst-ranked presidents were Hoover and Van Buren, tied. The 1994 survey placed only two presidents, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln, above 80 points and two presidents, Andrew Johnson and Warren G. Harding, below 50 points. Yellow-green  backgrounds indicate the median ranking of an odd number of presidents. Some respondents did not rate presidents that they were not familiar with. Memorability of the presidents\n2014 Roediger and DeSoto Survey\nIn November 2014, Henry L. Roediger III and K. Andrew DeSoto published a study in the journal Science asking research subjects to name as many presidents as possible.

Todd McFarlane (; born March 16, 1961) is a Canadian comic book creator, best known for his work as the artist on The Amazing Spider-Man and as the creator, writer, and artist on the superhero horror-fantasy series Spawn, as well as being the current President and a co-founder of Image Comics. ""Tony Twist wins battle over name: Judge orders comic artist pay $15 million"". He would sporadically return as the interior artist for intermittent issues, and for a few years wrote it under a pseudonym to generate interest in the book by fostering the illusion that new talent was being brought into the book\'s production. Media about McFarlane\nStan Lee interviewed McFarlane in Episode 1 of the 1991 documentary series The Comic Book Greats. The debut issue sold 1.7 million copies, which as of 2007, remains a record for an independent comic book. He has been credited as the character\'s co-creator, though this has been a topic of dispute within the comic book industry (see Eddie Brock: Creation and conception). He sought to play baseball professionally after graduation but suffered a serious ankle injury in his junior year during a game with arch-rivals Washington State University. Moreover, he could not afford Gonzaga, so he attended Spokane Falls Community College for a year, his relationship with Wanda developing into a long-distance one. His practical goal was to join his father in the printing business in Calgary, Alberta, though his dream was always to be a comic book creator. In July 2012 the original artwork to that issue\'s cover, which features Spider-Man dispatching the Hulk, sold for a record-breaking $657,250 USD, the highest auction price ever for any piece of American comic book art. Upon its release in 1992, Spawn #1 (May 1992) sold 1.7 million copies; as of 2007, this remains a record for an independent comic book. In January 2005, McFarlane announced that he was set to produce a half-hour anthology television series for Fox called Twisted Tales, based on the Bruce Jones\' comic book to which McFarlane had purchased the rights. Career\nEarly work, DC, and Marvel\nWhile still in college, McFarlane began sending 30–40 packages of submissions each month to comics editors, totaling over 700 submissions after a year and a half, most of which were in the form of pinups. This came to a head during a public debate they participated in at Philadelphia\'s Comicfest convention in October 1993, which was moderated by artist George Pérez. This strained McFarlane\'s relationship with Salicrup, which was expressed in the remarkable amount of public disagreement that appeared on the book\'s letters page. He subsequently focused on drawing, working at the comic book store to pay for the rest of his education, and living in a trailer park in Cheney, Washington with Wanda, who had moved to the area to be with him and attend EWU as well. That year marked the point when McFarlane ceased to be the regular writer and artist of Spawn. The book survived the comics speculator bubble\'s crash, but its sales have fluctuated, never matching the sales figures of the 1990s. The book, released on October 2 of that year, earned McFarlane a place in the Guinness World Records, for which McFarlane was given a certificate on October 5, 2019 at the New York Comic Con, prior to his panel, ""The Road to Historic Spawn 300 and 301."" It has become as much of an institution as it is a comic. In 2006, McFarlane announced plans for Spawn/Batman with artist Greg Capullo, which McFarlane wrote and inked, and which paid tribute to Jack Kirby. Despite his acclaim as an artist, according to David Wallace of Comics Bulletin, many found McFarlane\'s writing to be ""clumsy, unsophisticated and pretentious"", and questioned the wisdom of allowing him to write a new Spider-Man title in the first place. Greg Capullo penciled several issues as a guest artist, and became the regular penciler with #26, with McFarlane remaining as writer and inker until #70. In 2011, McFarlane was hired as an artist for the game Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, on which his duties included key frame art, storyboards and directing. Nonetheless, Shea Hennum of Paste magazine has observed of the series, ""It\'s a book that, for a time, people continued to buy because of the character instead of the creator. At San Diego Comic-Con 2022, it was announced that McFarlane would write a new Batman/S', ""From Frank Cho:\nAwards\n1994 College Cartoonist Charles M.

The coinciding release dates between Graduation and fellow American rapper 50 Cent\'s Curtis generated much publicity over the idea of a sales competition, resulting in record-breaking sales performances by both albums. Bringing the educational theme expressed by West\'s previous albums to a close, the visual plotline of the images contained within the liner notes lead up to a graduation ceremony that takes places within a fictional college institution situated within a futuristic metropolis called Universe City. Dropout attempts to hail a cab but it speeds right past him, soaking him with puddle water. Kanye led a wave of new artists— Kid Cudi, Wale, Lupe Fiasco, Kidz in the Hall, Drake—who lacked the interest or ability to create narratives about any past gunplay or drug-dealing"". It was made available two years later under the new title ""Home"" on West\'s 2003 mixtape Get Well Soon... and also on the advance copy of West\'s debut studio album The College Dropout, which due to a leak was never released. West described ""Stronger"" as an ""emancipation"", as he uses the song to vent his frustration over mistakes he has made in the past. The album prematurely concludes the education theme of West\'s first two studio albums, The College Dropout (2004) and Late Registration (2005), as his aborted Good Ass Job album would have concluded the concept album\'s themes as a tetralogy rather than a trilogy. By contrast, AllMusic\'s Andy Kellman wrote, ""Though the synthesizer use marks a clear, conscious diversion from Kanye\'s past productions, highlights ... are deeply rooted in the Kanye of old, using nostalgia-inducing samples, elegant pianos and strings, and gospel choirs"". West had previously experimented with the technology on his debut album The College Dropout for the background vocals on the songs ""Jesus Walks"" and ""Never Let Me Down"". As his verse draws to a close, West chastises that a person can\'t dwell on the past, and charges himself with living his life like he has no tomorrow. The College Dropout and Late Registration sold a combined 7 million copies in the U.S., but 50 Cent\'s own first two albums, Get Rich or Die Trying and The Massacre, sold nearly 14 million, almost exactly twice as much. The first week sales totals of Graduation and Curtis have outsold the first week sales totals of Guns N\' Roses\' two albums. At the concert, he provided live renditions of songs from Graduation and gave the audience a sneak peek of the early production stages of his fall Glow in the Dark Tour. Though he continued to use vocal samples, West gleaned them before also pushing the samples underneath the synths, causing them to ""sound like voices trapped in a huge machine, not like organic, subliminal connections to a mythical black-music past"". West cites it as one of this top three most favorite songs from Graduation. Since Graduation\'s release, countless other record producers have followed suit in blurring the lines of conventional hip-hop with the incorporation of electronic production. The guests were greeted by staff members wearing graduation robes and mortarboard caps in reference to the title of West\'s third studio album Graduation. Commercial performance\nOn the first day of its release, Graduation sold over 437,000 copies. West spent a significant amount of time promoting Graduation during his trip to the United Kingdom. For the issue date of September 20, 2007, Graduation debuted atop the Canadian Albums Chart. Graduation marked a musical progression towards synth-based production in regards to the art of crafting hip-hop beats. Industry awards\nGraduation won the award of Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Album at the American Music Awards of 2008, while also counting towards West earning the award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist. By year\'s end, Graduation was the third most-downloaded and best-selling album of 2007 on iTunes Store. Charts\nCertifications\nSee also\nReferences\nExternal links\nGraduation at Discogs (list of releases)\nSpotify link to playlist The cover art for Graduation was cited as the fifth best album cover of the year by Rolling Stone. Graduation started taking definite form around the time of the filming of the music video for its second single ""Stronger"", whereas prior West had been ""aimlessly making songs"". The outcome of the highly publicized sales competition between 50 Cent\'s Curtis and West\'s Graduation has been accredited to the commercial decline of the gangsta rap that once dominated mainstream hip-hop. Many songs on Graduation contain background vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian dance music group Sneaky Sound System. Legacy\nThe critical reception and commercial success of Graduation left a profound influence on both hip-hop culture and popular music.

Hillsborough County: Robert E. Lee Elementary School aka Lee Elementary Magnet School of World Studies and Technology was built 19', 'From Cold War:\nAccording to historian Robert L. Benson, ""Washington\'s forte was \'signals\' intelligence - the procurement and analysis of coded foreign messages."" The US and USSR were both part of the Allies of World War II, the military coalition which had defeated Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in 1945. Background and phases of the war\nThe roots of the Cold War can be traced back to diplomatic and military tensions preceding World War II. ""Revisionist"" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, disagreements about the future of Europe, particularly Eastern Europe, became central. Just a few places attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decision-making. Following the World War II Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south. The outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 changed the calculations and Washington now gave full support. During the whole duration of the cold war, the US and the USSR represented the largest and dominant space powers of the world. Origins of the term\nAt the end of World War II, English writer George Orwell used cold war, as a general term, in his essay ""You and the Atomic Bomb"", published 19 October 1945 in the British newspaper Tribune. Washington had the decisive voice. In July 2015, President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko signed a set of laws that started a six-month period for the removal of communist monuments (excluding World War II monuments) and renaming of public places named after communist-related themes. Containment, Truman Doctrine, Korean War (1947–53)\nIron Curtain, Iran, Türkiye, Greece, and Poland\nIn February 1946, George F. Kennan\'s ""Long Telegram"" from Moscow to Washington helped to articulate the US government\'s increasingly hard line against the Soviets, which would become the basis for US strategy toward the Soviet Union for the duration of the Cold War. In addition to the loss of life by uniformed soldiers, millions died in the superpowers\' proxy wars around the globe, most notably in eastern Asia. The American-Soviet tensions present during 1983 was defined by some as the start of ""Cold War II"". In 1955, Washington secured full German membership of NATO. Berlin Crisis of 1961\nThe Berlin Crisis of 1961 was the last major incident in the Cold War regarding the status of Berlin and post–World War II Germany. From the beginning of the post-war period, with American help Western Europe and Japan rapidly recovered from the destruction of World War II and sustained strong economic growth through the 1950s and 1960s, with per capita GDPs approaching those of the United States, while Eastern Bloc economies stagnated. Influence\nThe Cold War continues to influence world affairs. The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical tension and struggle for ideological and economic influence between the United States and the Soviet Union (USSR) and their respective allies, the Western Bloc and the Eastern Bloc, that started in 1947, two years after the end of World War II, and lasted until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Western Bloc included the US and a number of First World nations that were generally capitalist and liberal democratic but tied to a network of often authoritarian Third World states, most of which were the European powers\' former colonies. Washington\'s opposition to the Soviets accumulated after broken promises by Stalin and Molotov concerning Europe and Iran. In September, the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and ""co-authored"" by Vyacheslav Molotov; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability ""to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war"". With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war. The US initially seemed to follow containment when it first entered the war. These would become the main bureaucracies for US defense policy in the Cold War. The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before. The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. In his 1992 State of the Union Address, US President George H. W. Bush expressed his emotions: ""The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War."" Cumulative US military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8 trillion. He described the Soviet incursion as ""the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War"". In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War. Diggins says', 'From Arlington National Cemetery:\nThere are 32 British Commonwealth war dead burials, 12 from World War I and 20 from World War II and some headstones are Commonwealth War Graves Commission style. Lauri Törni, known for having served in the Finnish army during the Winter War, the German army during World War II, and the US army during the Vietnam War is buried at Arlington. With limited space but large numbers of KIAs from World War II, Korean War, Vietnam War, along with natural deaths from high-ranking military officials, the need for additional burial space at Arlington Cemetery became a challenge and priority to the U.S. government. British diplomat and Field Marshal Sir John Dill was buried at the cemetery when he died in Washington D.C. during World War II. The monument was dedicated November 11, 1927, and after the Korean War and World War II the names of US citizens who died in those conflicts were added.

Arlington National Cemetery was established on May 13, 1864, during the American Civil War after Arlington Estate, the land on which the cemetery was built, was confiscated by the U.S. federal government from the private ownership of Confederate States Army General Robert E. Lee\'s family following a tax dispute over the property. In January 2013, the county manager of Arlington County, Virginia, and the executive director of the Army National Military Cemeteries (consisting of Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers\' and Airmen\'s Home National Cemetery) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the Arlington County Board and the Department of the Army to expand the cemetery even further. ""African-American Civilians Interred in Section 27 of Arlington National Cemetery, 1864–1867"" (PDF). The memorial served as the temporary resting place for two foreign heads of state or government who died in exile in the United States during World War II, Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippines and Ignacy Jan Paderewski of Poland. On June 25, 1925, President Calvin Coolidge approved a request to erect a Commonwealth Cross of Sacrifice with the names of all the citizens of the United States who died fighting in the Canadian forces ', 'From Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Arlington National Cemetery):\nThe Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington County, Virginia, United States is the burial site (and the white, marble sarcophagus above it) of a World War I soldier there whose remains were unidentifiable. The ceremony can be witnessed by the public whenever Arlington National Cemetery is open. The Old Guard is also posted to Fort Myer, Virginia, adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery. Officials at Arlington National Cemetery determined that proper repair could return the Tomb Monument to an acceptable appearance. There are also national burial sites for unknowns from the First World War (also known as World War I, and the Great War) in England, France, Canada, Portugal, Italy, and elsewhere. Arlington National Cemetery has permitted the public to lay flowers at the Tomb on the three succeeding Memorial Days since the Centennial. On November 11, 1921, President Warren G. Harding officiated at the interment ceremonies at the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery. In June 2009 Arlington National Cemetery and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that the monument was to be repaired, not replaced. An Army caisson carried the Vietnam Unknown from the Capitol to the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day, May 28, 1984. Therefore, a report commissioned by Arlington National Cemetery and published in June 2006 confirmed the Cemetery\'s conclusion that ""replacement of the three pieces of the Tomb Monument is the preferred alternative"". In 2003, John Haines, a retired car dealer, offered to donate a large slab of marble to Arlington National Cemetery to replace the existing marble. President Eisenhower awarded each the Medal of Honor, and the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War were interred in the plaza beside their World War I comrade. The Trust expressed concern that Arlington National Cemetery sought to replace the existing monument with marble from the original quarry, which experts agreed was likely to eventually crack. The Unknowns of World War II and Korea\nOn August 3, 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who served as a general during World War II, signed a bill to select and pay tribute to the Unknowns of World War II and the Korean War. The Tomb Guard Identification Badge (TGIB) is awarded after the Tomb Guard Sentinel passes a series of tests, including one on the history of Arlington National Cemetery. The Korean unknown had been selected from four unknown Americans who died in the Korean War that were disinterred from the National Cemetery of the Pacific in Hawaii. Changing of the Guard\nWhile Arlington National Cemetery is open, during the day in the summer months from April 1 to September 30, the guard is changed every half hour. The block was sawed to final size in West Rutland, Vermont, and fabricated by craftsmen in Proctor, Vermont, before it was shipped by train to Arlington National Cemetery, Virginia. Tomb guards are required to memorize 35 pages of information about Arlington National Cemetery and the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, including the locations of nearly 300 graves and who is buried in each one. The Unknown of World War I\nOn Memorial Day, 1921, four unknown servicemen were exhumed from four World War I American cemeteries in France, Aisne-Marne, Meuse-Argonne, Somme, and St. Mihiel. The caskets of the WWII and Korean unknowns arrived in Washington on May 28, 1958, where they lay in the Capitol Rotunda until the morning of May 30, when they were carried on caissons to Arlington National Cemetery. The Tomb was placed at the head of the grave of the World War I Unknown. The U.S. Unknowns from World War II and Korea are also recipients of the Medal of Honor. ""The Unknown Soldier of World War I, State Funeral, 23 October–11 November 1921"". Younger selected the World War I Unknown by placing a spray of white roses on one of the caskets. The TUS has been called the ""Tomb of the Unknowns"" when referring to the combined three or four burials from World War I, World War II, Korea (and Vietnam), but it is still officially called the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It also includes the gravesites of two other unknowns, one from World War II and one from the Korean War buried under two slabs between it and the Memorial Amphitheater behind it. West of this grave are the crypts of Unknowns from World War II (south) and Korea (north). The World War II Unknown was selected from remains exhumed from cemeteries in Europe, Africa, Hawaii, and the Philippines. The World War I Unknown lay in state in the Capitol Rotunda from his arrival in the United States until Armistice Day 1921. The World War I ""Unknown"" is a recipient of the Medal of Honor, the Victoria Cross, and several other foreign nations\' highest service awards. During the ceremony, the World War I Unknown was awarded the Victoria Cross by Admiral of the Fleet Lord Beatty, on behalf of King George V of the United Kingdom.

At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton founded the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund with George W. Bush and Barack Obama. His sudden spike in popularity during this time was attributed to Americans comparing him to then-incumbent Democratic president Barack Obama, who had low approval ratings. In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti\'s recovery. Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad. The claim ""Slick Willie"" would last throughout his presidency. His prominent role in campaigning for Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname ""Explainer-in-Chief"". He has also been honored with a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding, a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design), and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community. He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001. On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities. Considering Bill\'s remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Irish peace talks\nIn 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the British government. A Freedom of Information Act request for United States Secret Service records of visits Clinton may have made to Little St. James produced no such evidence. 1988 Democratic presidential primaries\nIn 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the presidential race. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is ""ready to lead"". 2008 presidential election\nDuring the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton ""the first black president"", saying, ""Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald\'s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas"". 2016 presidential election and after\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, and made appearances speaking on the campaign trail. Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Such remarks led to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama\'s election. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. The agreement led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, however, this did not end the conflict. The televised exchange led to AIDS becoming an issue in the 1992 presidential election. His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba starting from the 1992 presidential election. Opponents sometimes referred to him as ""Slick Willie"", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg; Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor. In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on UN safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004. 1996 presidential campaign\nLeading up to the 1996 presidential election, Clinton\'s chances of being re-elected initially seemed slim, partially due to his growing untrust among the general public due to the Whitewater controversy and the lopsided defeat of national Democrats in the 1994 elections. He has remained active in Democratic Party polit', 'From Nelson Mandela:\nAmong his awards were the Nobel Peace Prize, the US Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Soviet Union\'s Lenin Peace Prize, and the Libyan Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Globally regarded as an icon of democracy and social justice, he received more than 250 honours, including the Nobel Peace Prize. He spoke with US senator Hillary Clinton and President George W. Bush and first met the then-senator Barack Obama. Soon after ANC leader Luthuli was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, MK publicly announced its existence with 57 bombings on Dingane\'s Day (16 December) 1961, followed by further attacks on New Year\'s Eve. Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed ""Genadendal"", meaning ""Valley of Mercy"" in Afrikaans. He was replaced by Commander Willie Willemse, who developed a co-operative relationship with Mandela and was keen to improve prison standards. Subsequently, the years 2019 to 2028 were also designated the United Nations Nelson Mandela Decade of Peace. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the United States, independently meeting President Bill Clinton, and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Emphasising personal forgiveness and reconciliation, he announced that ""courageous people do not fear forgiving, for the sake of peace."" The tenets of the Freedom Charter remained important for Mandela, and in 1956 he described it as ""an inspiration to the people of South Africa"". The 1955 Freedom Charter, which Mandela had helped create, called for the nationalisation of banks, gold mines and land, to ensure equal distribution of wealth. Based on the responses, a Freedom Charter was drafted by Rusty Bernstein, calling for the creation of a democratic, non-racialist state with the nationalisation of major industry. In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued. He held a conviction that ""inclusivity, accountability and freedom of speech"" were the fundamentals of democracy, and was driven by a belief in natural and human rights. The trial gained international attention; there were global calls for the release of the accused from the United Nations and World Peace Council, while the University of London Union voted Mandela to its presidency. He was awarded an honorary doctorate in Lesotho, the Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding in India in 1979, and the Freedom of the City of Glasgow, Scotland in 1981. In doing so, Lodge argued that Mandela became ""one of the first media politicians ... embodying a glamour and a style that projected visually a brave new African world of modernity and freedom"". In 2004, Johannesburg granted Mandela the Freedom of the City, and in 2008 a Mandela statue was unveiled at the spot where Mandela was released from prison. Although he set about authoring a sequel to his first autobiography, to be titled The Presidential Years, it remained unfinished and was only published posthumously in 2017. On the left, some voices in the ANC—among them Frank B. Wilderson III—accused him of selling out for agreeing to enter negotiations with the apartheid government and for not implementing the reforms of the Freedom Charter during his presidency. Although dismantling press censorship, speaking out in favour of freedom of the press and befriending many journalists, Mandela was critical of much of the country\'s media, noting that it was overwhelmingly owned and run by middle-class whites and believing that it focused too heavily on scaremongering about crime. Mandela spurned the offer, releasing a statement through his daughter Zindzi stating, ""What freedom am I being offered while the organisation of the people [ANC] remains banned? The ANC decided to send Mandela as a delegate to the February 1962 meeting of the Pan-African Freedom Movement for East, Central and Southern Africa (PAFMECSA) in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.

After being awarded the medal, Cosby was convicted of multiple counts of sexual assault, though the convictions were later overturned. Country musician Dolly Parton turned down the medal twice from Donald Trump. At the age of 25, athlete and activist Simone Biles is the youngest person to receive this award as of 2022. Background\nTypically the medal is bestowed upon the recipient by the sitting president who has chosen them. Colin Powell received his second award with Distinction, while Ellsworth Bunker was given both of his awards with Distinction. Parton said she turned it down the first time because her husband was ill, and the second time because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum\'s official website. Colin Powell received two awards, his second being with Distinction; Ellsworth Bunker received both of his awards with Distinction. In 2017, President Barack Obama stated that receiving the award with distinction indicates ""an additional level of veneration"" in a class of individuals already held in the highest esteem. As of June 2024, the medal has been awarded with distinction at least 55 times, amounting to approximately 8% of all awards. The order establishing the medal also expanded the size and the responsibilities of the Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board so it could serve as a major source of such recommendations. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the highest civilian award of the United States, alongside the Congressional Gold Medal. The Presidential Medal of Freedom is the supreme civilian decoration that can be awarded in discretion of the president, whereas its predecessor, the Medal of Freedom, was inferior in precedence to the Medal for Merit; the Medal of Freedom was awarded by any of three Cabinet secretaries, whereas the Medal for Merit was awarded by the president, as is the Presidential Medal of Freedom. ""Presidential Medal of Freedom Recipients"", a list of recipients from May 5, 1993, through August 19, 2009, from the U.S. Senate official website. A special and rarely granted award, called the Presidential Medal of Freedom with Distinction, has a larger version of the same badge, which is worn as a star on the left chest. Insignia\nThe badge of the Presidential Medal of Freedom is in the form of a golden star with white enamel, with a red enamel pentagon behind it; the central disc bears thirteen gold stars on a blue enamel background (taken from the Great Seal of the United States) within a golden ring. Overview\nPresident John F. Kennedy established the presidential version of the decoration in 1963 through Executive Order 11085 (signed February 22, 1963), with unique and distinctive insignia, vastly expanded purpose, and far higher prestige. ""War Figures Honored With Medal of Freedom"". The recipient selection process is not made public, but the Trump administration stated that it included recommendations and nominations from the public, Cabinet, White House senior staff, and other presidential advisory bodies, which were then vetted prior to presentation to the President. It is an award bestowed by decision of the president of the United States to ""any person recommended to the President for award of the Medal or any person selected by the President upon his own initiative,"" and was created to recognize people who have made ""an especially meritorious contribution to (1) the security or national interests of the United States, or (2) world peace, or (3) cultural or other significant public or private endeavors."" It was the first U.S. civilian neck decoration and, if awarded with Distinction, is the only U.S. sash and star decoration (the Chief Commander degree of the Legion of Merit—which may only be awarded to foreign heads of state—is a star decoration but without a sash). It comes with a sash that is worn over the right shoulder (similarly to the Grand Cross of an order of chivalry), with its rosette (blue with a white edge, bearing the central disc of the badge at its center) resting on the left hip.

The observing site that found this asteroid is part of a large observatory known for discovering a planet. What is the difference in years between the discovery of this asteroid and the discovery of the planet?', 'From New Horizons:\nWhen the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet, later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto\'s moon Charon. Stamatios ""Tom"" Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory\'s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. Appointed as the project\'s principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as ""the personification of the Pluto mission"". Asteroid 132524 APL\nBecause of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter. This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph\'s capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid\'s composition as well as light and phase curves. About 30 grams (1 oz) of Clyde Tombaugh\'s ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. In May 2006 it was discovered that New Horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. New Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile, the 8.2-meter Subaru Observatory in Hawaii and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope were used to search for potential targets. The ground-based search resulted in the discovery of about 143 KBOs of potential interest, but none of these were close enough to the flight path of New Horizons. History\nIn August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. One of the science packages (a dust counter) is named after Venetia Burney, who, as a child, suggested the name ""Pluto"" after its discovery. Mission profile\nNew Horizons is the first mission in NASA\'s New Frontiers mission category, larger and more expensive than the Discovery missions but smaller than the missions of the Flagship Program. ""By way of comparison, New Horizons gathered 5,000 times as much data at Pluto as Mariner did at the Red Planet."" On August 25, 2014, New Horizons crossed the orbit of Neptune, exactly 25 years after the planet was visited by the Voyager 2 probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). After astronomers announced the discovery of two new moons in the Pluto system, Kerberos and Styx, mission planners started contemplating the possibility of the probe running into unseen debris and dust left over from ancient collisions between the moons. The dwarf planet Haumea was observed from afar by the New Horizons spacecraft in October 2007, January 2017, and May 2020, from distances of 49 AU, 59 AU, and 63 AU, respectively. The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons\' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons\' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet\'s atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave provisional designations to the three target KBOs: 2014 MU69 (later 486958 Arrokoth) (PT1), 2014 OS393 (PT2), and 2014 PN70 (PT3). On July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare. New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe launched as a part of NASA\'s New Frontiers program.

Anderson Mesa Station is an astronomical observatory established in 1959 as a dark-sky observing site for Lowell Observatory. In 1930 it was used by Clyde Tombaugh to discover Pluto. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL). The 0.33 m (13 in) Abbot L. Lowell Astrograph, also known as the Pluto Discovery Telescope and informally as the Pluto Camera, is an astrograph built by Alvan Clark & Sons in 1929. It is located at Anderson Mesa in Coconino County, Arizona, about 12 miles (19 km) southeast of Lowell's main campus on Mars Hill in Flagstaff, Arizona. It was named after former Lowell Observatory director John S. Hall in 1990. The Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) is collaboration of Lowell Observatory, the U.S. It was built by J. W. Fecker, Inc. in 1939, given to Perkins Observatory in the 1950s, and purchased by Lowell in 1990. Built in 1931 by Warner & Swasey Company, it was originally located at the Perkins Observatory of Ohio Wesleyan University (OWU) in Delaware, Ohio. Former telescopes\nThe 0.6 m (24 in) Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) Schmidt camera was used to search for asteroids and other near-earth objects. The 0.79 m (31 in) telescope of the National Undergraduate Research Observatory (NURO) was built by AstroMechanics and installed in 1964 at Anderson Mesa by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) for Project Apollo. Telescopes\nCurrent telescopes\nThe 1.83 m (72 in) Perkins Telescope is shared with Boston University (BU) and Georgia State University. It was moved to Anderson Mesa in 1961, and was purchased by Lowell in 1998. Lowell and BU formed a partnership to operate the telescope that year, and GSU joined later. The original 69-inch mirror, which was figured by J. W. Fecker, Inc., was the largest single piece of glass ever cast in America when it was poured. It was replaced in 1965 with the current mirror made of Duran-50 low-expansion glass. The 1.07 m (42 in) John Hall Telescope was built by AstroMechanics and installed at Anderson Mesa in 1970. In 2004, the Ritchey-Chrétien telescope was upgraded with a new mirror from Hextek, and with other parts. It was purchased by Lowell in 1972, and refurbished in 1990. It is used by the NURO consortium for up to 60% of the time, and by Lowell scientists. Construction on the facility began in 1992, and engineering tests began in 1994. The first images were acquired in 1996. Starting in 1992 it was refurbished, and saw first light in the dome that previously held the Lowell Astrograph in 1997. Use of the telescope ended along with the LONEOS project in 2008. In 1971, it was moved a new building at Anderson Mesa, and returned to Mars Hill in 1992."", 'From Flagstaff, Arizona:\nIn 1955, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was established. Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station, the U.S. Geological Survey, and Northern Arizona University. Scientific and high tech research and development operations are in the city, including Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey\'s (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by Clyde Tombaugh\'s 1930 discovery of Pluto from the Lowell Observatory. Dark Sky City\nFlagstaff takes one of its nicknames from its designation as the world\'s first International Dark Sky City, with deliberate measures to reduce light pollution beginning in 1958 supported by the environmentally-aware population and community advocates, government and elected officials, and the assistance of observatories in the area – including the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station and Lowell Observatory. In 1930, Pluto was discovered from Flagstaff. The highest restrictions are in south and west Flagstaff (near NAU and its observatory), and at the Naval, Braeside, and Lowell Observatories. The Lowell Observatory is a National Historic Landmark. More than 100,000 people visited in both 2018 and 2019; in 2019 the observatory opened its new Giovale Open Deck Observatory, an observation plaza with a suite of six advanced telescopes. Flagstaff is also home to Arizona\'s first commercial solar power generating station, which was built in 1997 and provides 87 kW of electricity. Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak at the downtown Flagstaff station, connecting on east–west routes to Los Angeles and Albuquerque via the Southwest Chief line. The primary generating station near Flagstaff is the coal-fired, 995-MW Cholla Power Plant, near Holbrook, which uses coal from the McKinley Mine in New Mexico. Lowell Observatory and NOFS also are collaborators on the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. In 1894, A. E. Douglass recommended Flagstaff to Percival Lowell as the site for the Lowell Observatory, where it was built on Mars Hill. In 2012 the observatory commissioned its Lowell Discovery Telescope, a 4.3-meter telescope with an instrument cube that can hold five instruments at once. Naval astronomer, and Diskan had originally moved to Flagstaff from Los Angeles so that his children could grow up able to see stars, saying that ""part of being human is looking up at the stars and being awestruck."" Before this, it had been nicknamed the ""Skylight City"" in the 1890s, the same decade that the Lowell Observatory was founded. Lowell Observatory celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2019 and continues to be a leading astronomical research center, as well as a popular destination for visitors. Historic districts and properties\nFlagstaff is home to seven National Register of Historic Places historic districts: Southside, Townsite, Fort Tuthill, North End, Northern Arizona Normal School, the Railroad Addition, and USFS Fort Valley Experimental Forest Station, as well as a variety of many other structures and areas. During the Apollo program in the 1960s, the Lowell Observatory Clark Telescope was used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) to map the Moon for the lunar expeditions, enabling the mission planners to choose a safe landing site for the lunar modules. Several films then used Flagstaff\'s Route 66 in scenes: the 1969 film Easy Rider were filmed on Milton Road and Route 66 as well as near Sunset Crater; a moment in the film National Lampoon\'s Vacation was filmed at a truck stop gas station near Little America Hotel in 1983; a small scene in Midnight Run was filmed in Flagstaff at the train depot, and the city was referenced in the film; several of the running scenes in Forrest Gump were filmed in and around the area, including a memorable scene in which Forrest is seen jogging in downtown Flagstaff and gives inspiration to a bumper sticker designer; parts of 2007 Academy Award winner Little Miss Sunshine were filmed at the junction of I-40 and I-17 in Flagstaff; and Terminal Velocity was partially filmed in the city.

The structure built by the Ancestral Puebloans is located in Mesa Verde National Park in their former homeland region. It was discovered by Carl D. Anderson and Seth Henry Neddermeyer in 1936 while they studied cosmic radiation. Its diameter is roughly three-quarters that of Pluto. 2005 Nix\nNix is a natural satellite of Pluto. 2005 Hydra\nHydra is the outer-most natural satellite of Pluto. Perdita\'s discovery was complicated. The ancient ruins of Cliff Palace were co-discovered during a snowstorm in December 1888 by Richard Wetherill and Charlie Mason who were searching for stray cattle on Chapin Mesa. The original Golden Delicious tree is thought to have been discovered by Anderson Mullins on a hill near Porter Creek in Clay County, West Virginia. 1964 1930 Lucifer\n\n1930 Lucifer was a main-belt asteroid discovered at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) in Flagstaff, Arizona on October 29, 1964, by American astronomer Elizabeth Roemer. It is approximately 2,500 kilometres in diameter and 27% more massive than the dwarf planet Pluto. 1932 Positrons\n\nThe existence of positrons was first postulated in 1928 by Paul Dirac as a consequence of the Dirac equation and later discovered in 1932 by Carl D. Anderson, who gave the positron its name. The first discovery of the Xi particle was at Brookhaven National Laboratory in 1964. However, this discovery remained stored until Charles W. Gilmore named the dinosaur in 1913. In 1952, Dr. Jonas Salk announced his discovery of a trial vaccine for Polio, or poliomyelitis. This discovery proved the existence of a galaxy over one million light-years away and thus extragalactic astronomy was created.

Christy on June 22, 1978, while working at the United States Naval Observatory, is the largest moon of the dwarf planet Pluto. Nereid was discovered on May 1, 1949, by Gerard Kuiper, who proposed the name in the report of his discovery. The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded, in 1978, to Daniel Nathans, Werner Arber, and Hamilton O. Smith for the discovery of restriction endonucleases. The discovery of vitamin A stemmed from research dating back to 1906, indicating that factors other than carbohydrates, proteins, and fats were necessary to keep cattle healthy. The CMB\'s discovery in 1964 by astronomers Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson was the culmination of work initiated in the 1940s, earning them a Nobel Prize in 1978. After the discovery of the wreckage of the RMS Titanic in 1985, Dr. Robert D. Ballard\'s next goal was to find and film the wreck of the Bismarck. In 1986, Robert Weinberg and a team of researchers working under his direction made a seminal discovery when they isolated Rb, or the retinoblastoma protein, the first known growth-suppressor gene. Dr. Johanson\'s girlfriend suggested she be named ""Lucy"" after the Beatles\' song ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds"" which was played repeatedly during the night of the discovery. The 2005 discovery of KV63, located about 50 feet (15 m) away from King Tut\'s tomb, is credited to American Egyptologist Dr. Otto Schaden and his team from the University of Memphis. Its discovery was made independently by two research groups, one at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, headed by Burton Richter, and one at the Brookhaven National Laboratory, headed by Samuel Ting at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Its discovery was a serendipitous product of their continuing search for ""near-Earth objects"", and the ""9"" indicates that it was the ninth short-period comet (period less than 200 years) discovered by this team. It was discovered along with Hydra in June 2005 by the Hubble Space Telescope\'s Pluto Companion Search Team, composed of Hal A. Weaver, Alan Stern, Max J. Mutchler, Andrew J. Steffl, Marc W. Buie, William J. Merline, John R. Spencer, Eliot F. Young, and Leslie A. The history of cyanoacrylates is one of accidental discovery when researchers under Dr. Harry Coover conducted experiments on adhesive chemicals in order to devise a clear plastic that could be used for pre', 'From United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station:\nThe United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS), is an astronomical observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona, US. The United States Naval Observatory, Flagstaff Station celebrated its 50th anniversary of the move there from Washington, D.C., in late 2005. Navy Precision Optical Interferometer\nNOFS operates the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer (NPOI) in collaboration with Lowell Observatory and the Naval Research Laboratory at Anderson Mesa, 15 miles (24 km) south-east of Flagstaff. (Pluto itself was discovered in 1930, across town at Lowell Observatory). It is the national dark-sky observing facility under the United States Naval Observatory (USNO). Dr. John Hall, Director of the Naval Observatory\'s Equatorial Division from 1947, founded NOFS. FASTT was also used to help NASA\'s SOFIA Airborne Observatory correctly locate, track and image a rare Pluto occultation. General information\nThe Flagstaff Station is a command which was established by USNO (due to a century of eventually untenable light encroachment in Washington, D.C.) at a site five miles (8.0 km) west of Flagstaff, Arizona in 1955, and has positions for primarily operational scientists (astronomers and astrophysicists), optical and mechanical engineers, and support staff. 0.2-m FASTT\nA modern-day example of a fully robotic transit telescope is the small 0.20-meter (8-inch) Flagstaff Astrometric Scanning Transit Telescope (FASTT) completed in 1981 and located at the observatory. The Ritchey is the original Station telescope which was moved from USNO in Washington in 1955. The Charon discovery led to mass calculations which ultimately revealed how tiny Pluto was, and eventually caused the IAU to reclassify Pluto as a dwarf (not a principal) planet. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) also provides additional funds to contract Lowell Observatory\'s and NRL\'s implementation of additional, long-baseline siderostat stations, facilitating NRL\'s primary scientific work, synthetic imaging (both celestial and of orbital satellites). Flagstaff and Coconino County minimize northern Arizona light pollution through legislation of progressive code – which regulates local lighting. In 1978, the 1.55-m telescope was used to ""discover the moon of dwarf planet Pluto, named \'Charon\'"". The Navy provides stewardship of the facility, land and related dark sky protection efforts through its Navy Region Southwest, through Naval Air Facility El Centro. Notable events have included support to the Apollo Astronaut program hosted by USGS\' nearby Astrogeology Research Center; and the discovery of Pluto\'s moon, Charon, in 1978 (discussed below). Dr. Art Hoag became its first director in 1955 (until 1965); both later were to also become directors of nearby Lowell Observatory. Instrumental to the navigation of many NASA deep space probes, data from this telescope is responsible for NASA JPL\'s successful 2005 navigation-to-landing of the Huygens Lander on Titan, a major moon orbiting Saturn, and provided navigational reference for NASA\'s New Horizons deep space mission to Pluto, which arrived in July 2015. NOFS (the operational astrometric arm of USNO) funds all principle operations, and from this contracts Lowell Observatory to maintain the Anderson Mesa facility and make the observations necessary for NOFS to conduct the primary astrometric science. As noted, the majority of interferometric science and operations are funded and managed by NOFS; however, Lowell Observatory and NRL join in the scientific efforts through their fractions of time to use the interferometer; 85% Navy (NOFS and NRL); and 15% Lowell. NOFS and USNO combine as the Celestial Reference Frame manager for the U.S. Secretary of Defense. NOFS science supports every aspect of positional astronomy to some level, providing national support and beyond. Work at NOFS covers the gamut of astrometry and astrophysics in order to facilitate its production of accurate/precise astronomical catalogs. Also, owing to the celestial dynamics (and relativistic effects) of the huge number of such moving objects across their own treks through space, the time expanse required to pin down each set of celestial locations and motions for a perhaps billion-star catalog, can be quite long. Multiple observations of each object may themselves take weeks, months or years, by themselves. This, multiplied by the large number of cataloged objects that must then be reduced for use, and which must be analyzed after observation for a very careful statistical understanding of all catalog errors, forces the rigorous production of most extremely precise and faint astrometric catalogs to take many years, sometimes decades, to complete. NOFS has had 6 directors since 1955; its current and 7th acting director is Dr. Scott Dahm. NOFS remains active in supporting regional dark skies, both to support its national protection mission, and to promote and protect a national resource legacy for generations of humans to come.

Another was The Bellman, which began publishing in 1906 and ended in 1919, was edited by William Crowell Edgar and was based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The North American Review, founded in 1815, is the oldest American literary magazine. However, it had its publication suspended during World War II, and the Yale Review (founded in 1819) did not; thus the Yale journal is the oldest literary magazine in continuous publication. The Committee of Small Magazine Editors and Publishers (COSMEP) was founded by Richard Morris in 1968. In Great Britain, critics Francis Jeffrey, Henry Brougham and Sydney Smith founded the Edinburgh Review in 1802. Founded in 1912, it published T. S. Eliot\'s first poem, ""The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock"". The Sewanee Review, although founded in 1892, achieved prominence largely thanks to Allen Tate, who became editor in 1944.

Among the important journals which began in this period were Nimbus: A Magazine of Literature, the Arts, and New Ideas, which began publication in 1951 in England, the Paris Review, which was founded in 1953, The Massachusetts Review and Poetry Northwest, which were founded in 1959, X Magazine, which ran from 1959 to 1962, and the Denver Quarterly, which began in 1965. Online literary magazines\nSwiftCurrent, created in 1984, was the first online literary magazine. It functioned as more of a database of literary works than a literary publication. The most prominent Canadian literary magazine of the 19th century was the Montreal-based Literary Garland. Literary magazines are often called literary journals, or little magazines, terms intended to contrast them with larger, commercial magazines. Since then, though, many writers and readers have accepted online literary magazines as another step in the evolution of independent literary journals.

In 1995, the Mississippi Review was the first large literary magazine to launch a fully online issue. Literary magazines also provide many of the pieces in The Best American Short Stories and The Best American Essays annual volumes. The middle-20th century saw a boom in the number of literary magazines, which corresponded with the rise of the small press. By the end of the century, literary magazines had become an important feature of intellectual life in many parts of the world. Little magazines\nLittle magazines, or ""small magazines"", are literary magazines that often publish experimental literature and the non-conformist writings of relatively unknown writers. Several prominent literary magazines were published in Charleston, South Carolina, including The Southern Review (1828–32) and Russell\'s Magazine (1857–60). History\nNouvelles de la république des lettres is regarded as the first literary magazine; it was established by Pierre Bayle in France in 1684. There are thousands of other online literary publications and it is difficult to judge the quality and overall impact of this relatively new publishing medium. Some short fiction writers, such as Steve Almond, Jacob M. Appel and Stephen Dixon have built national reputations in the United States primarily through publication in literary magazines.

In 1936 Clayton was hired by Liberty, and Jack Byrne, who had been working at Fiction House, took over as editor for a year before being replaced by Chandler Whipple. In 1906 Munsey had started The Railroad Man\'s Magazine, which carried both fiction and non-fiction; after the January 18, 1919 issue it was merged into The Argosy, which was briefly retitled Argosy and Railroad Man\'s Magazine, reverting to just Argosy with the May 31 issue.

Most of the other major fiction magazines of the day increased their price to twenty cents ($6.08 in 2023). Johnston McCulley had launched his Zorro series in All-Story in 1919 and more episodes appeared in Argosy after the two magazines merged. Albert Payson Terhune, later the author of Lad: A Dog, frequently published in the Munsey magazines early in his career. There were also two associated magazines: Argosy UFO appeared in July 1976 and ceased publication with its eighth issue, dated Winter 1977/1978. Peterson suggests that it was the success of these two magazines that led to the expansion of the men\'s magazine market during the 1950s.

Chesterton:\nThe American Chesterton Society has devoted a whole issue of its magazine, Gilbert, to defending Chesterton against charges of antisemitism. Writing\nChesterton wrote around 80 books, several hundred poems, some 200 short stories, 4,000 essays (mostly newspaper columns), and several plays. G. K. Chesterton: Quotidiana\nG. K.

Chesterton in the 20th Century Press Archives of the ZBW\nScuola Libera G. K. Chesterton, retrieved 3 September 2023\nSocietà Chestertoniana Italiana, retrieved 3 September 2023 Gilbert Keith Chesterton  (29 May 1874 – 14 June 1936) was an English author, philosopher, Christian apologist, and literary and art critic. Chesterton created the fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and wrote on apologetics, such as his works Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an orthodox Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting from high church Anglicanism. Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, John Henry Newman and John Ruskin. He has been referred to as the ""prince of paradox"". Of his writing style, Time observed: ""Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories—first carefully turning them inside out."" His writings were an influence on Jorge Luis Borges, who compared his work with that of Edgar Allan Poe. Biography\nEarly life\nChesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, on 29 May 1874. His father was Edward Chesterton, an estate agent, and his mother was Marie Louise, née Grosjean, of Swiss-French origin. Chesterton was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England, though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians. According to his autobiography, as a young man he became fascinated with the occult and, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards. He was educated at St Paul\'s School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but he did not complete a degree in either subject. He married Frances Blogg in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to Anglicanism, though he later considered Anglicanism to be a ""pale imitation"". He entered in full communion with the Catholic Church in 1922. The couple were unable to have children. A friend from schooldays was Edmund Clerihew Bentley, inventor of the clerihew, a whimsical four-line biographical poem. Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend\'s first published collection of poetry, Biography for Beginners (1905), which popularised the clerihew form. He became godfather to Bentley\'s son, Nicolas, and opened his novel The Man Who Was Thursday with a poem written to Bentley. Career\nIn September 1895, Chesterton began working for the London publisher George Redway, where he remained for just over a year. In October 1896, he moved to the publishing house T. Fisher Unwin, where he remained until 1902. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902, The Daily News gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in The Illustrated London News, for which he continued to write for the next thirty years. Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition, repentance and reconciliation. For example, in the story ""The Flying Stars"", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: ""There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don\'t fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil. That road goes down and down. The kind man drinks and turns cruel; the frank man kills and lies about it. Many a man I\'ve known started like you to be an honest outlaw, a merry robber of the rich, and ended stamped into slime."" Chesterton loved to debate, often engaging in friendly public disputes with such men as George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Bertrand Russell and Clarence Darrow. According to his autobiography, he and Shaw played cowboys in a silent film that was never released.

The magazine continued publishing controversial articles and stories about various aspects of Soviet and Russian history despite the fact that its editor-in-chief, Alexander Tvardovsky, facing significant political pressure, resigned in February 1970. It was supposed to be modelled on the popular pre-Soviet literary magazine Mir Bozhy (""God\'s World""), which was published from 1892 to 1906, and its follow-up, Sovremenny Mir (""Contemporary World""), which was published from 1906 to 1917.

CODAP: French Code for Construction of Unfired Pressure Vessel. ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section VIII: Rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels. These vessels also require an authorised inspector to sign off on every new vessel constructed and each vessel has a nameplate with pertinent information about the vessel, such as maximum allowable working pressure, maximum temperature, minimum design metal temperature, what company manufactured it, the date, its registration number (through the National Board), and American Society of Mechanical Engineers's official stamp for pressure vessels (U-stamp). The base is first closed completely, and trimmed to form a smooth internal surface before the shoulder and neck are formed. the pressure difference between the interior of the pressure vessel and the surroundings is the primary characteristic considered for design and construction. Gas storage capacity\nIn looking at the first equation, the factor PV, in SI units, is in units of (pressurization) energy. Construction materials\nMany pressure vessels are made of steel. Firemen need slim, lightweight cylinders to move in confined spaces; since about 1995 cylinders for 300 bars (4,400 psi) WP were used (first in pure steel). BS 4994: Specification for design and construction of vessels and tanks in reinforced plastics. Construction methods and materials may be chosen to suit the pressure application, and will depend on the size of the vessel, the contents, working pressure, mass constraints, and the number of items required. Construction is tested using nondestructive testing, such as ultrasonic testing, radiography, and pressure tests. Cold extrusion (aluminium):\nSeamless aluminium cylinders may be manufactured by cold backward extrusion of aluminium billets in a process which first presses the walls and base, then trims the top edge of the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. Nearly all recognize the inherent potential hazards of pressure vessels and the need for standards and codes regulating their design and construction. Scaling\nNo matter what shape it takes, the minimum mass of a pressure vessel scales with the pressure and volume it contains and is inversely proportional to the strength to weight ratio of the construction material (minimum mass decreases as strength increases).

The delivery of the ships is scheduled to commence from September 2026. They will have a cruising speed of 14 knots (26 km/h; 16 mph) with a maximum speed greater than 25 knots (46 km/h; 29 mph) and an operating range of 8,500 nautical miles (15,700 km; 9,800 mi) at a speed of 14–15 knots (26–28 km/h; 16–17 mph). Of the 11 ships, seven will be designed, developed and manufactured by GSL and four by GRSE. The Helipad can accommodate a helicopter of 15 t (15 long tons) with facility to operate UAVs. The primary role of the vessels to maintain Indian Navy's combat capability and meet various operational requirements such as Anti piracy, Counter-Infiltration, Anti poaching, Anti trafficking, Non combatant evacuation operations, Search and Rescue (SAR), Protection of Offshore Assets and Mine warfare. The ships will be equipped with state of the art facility and a hangar which can accommodate one HAL Dhruv. The deal was signed on 30 March 2023 with the delivery of the ships is scheduled to commence from September 2026. These ship will be able to perform mine warfare roles with modular payload, presumably by the usage of UUVs and autonomous mine laying vehicles. Later on, the number of ships to be built was increased to eleven to compensate for the time lost due to the cancelled Shachi class project. The order value share for the Goa Shipyard (GSL) is ₹6,200 crore (US$740 million) while that of Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) is ₹3,500 crore (US$420 million). Indian Navy re-released a new RFI in 2017 for six ships which was later cleared by the Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) in 2018 for a price of ₹4,941 crore (equivalent to ₹66 billion or US$790 million in 2023). The project was subjected to competitive bidding and shipyards across the country participated. Amongst the public sector participants were Cochin Shipyard, Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers, Goa Shipyard, Hindustan Shipyard and  Mazagon Dock while Larsen & Toubro was the sole private bidder. Goa Shipyard was declared the lowest bidder (L1) while Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers was the second lowest L2. Contract was subsequently signed with both the shipyards. All the ships will be fitted with 2 such radars. GRSE laid keels for two NGOPVs at Yard Y3037 and Y3038 on 5 November 2024. The ship would be equipped with light weapons like 76mm main cannon along with CIWS systems and counter-measure system like Kavach decoy launchers and Maareech torpedo-countermeasure systems. The ship will have the ability to store Shyena torpedoes for helicopter."", ""From USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E):\nIn the novels published by Pocket Books after Nemesis, the Enterprise-E remains under the command of Picard as of 2385 in the 2013 novel miniseries Star Trek: The Fall. When Picard took command of the USS Verity, Worf is appointed as captain of the Enterprise-E in the Star Trek: Picard tie-in novel The Last Best Hope. Once the Enterprise arrives over Earth shortly after the Borg vessel, the vessel quickly targets a particular spot on Earth and attacks, but the Enterprise manages to destroy it before it does any serious damage. After the attack, the Enterprise crew determine that they have arrived in the year 2063, the year humanity made first contact with the Vulcans, and they also determine that the Borg vessel's target was Bozeman, Montana, the launch site of Cochrane's first faster-than-light flight. According to the non-canon novel Ship of the Line, the originally planned name for the vessel was USS Honorius, and Montgomery Scott was part of the team of engineers that designed the Enterprise-E. In the non-canon 2007 novel Death in Winter, she again took a position as head of Starfleet Medical, but returned to the Enterprise in the novel Resistance, and has since married Captain Picard. The Borg cube launches a smaller vessel prior to its destruction, which travels back in time in an attempt to stop Zefram Cochrane's first contact with the Vulcans, thus preventing the Federation from ever being formed, although the Enterprise crew are as yet unaware of this plan as they follow the vessel into the temporal vortex it had created to travel through time. Following Riker's departure at the end of that film, Worf was promoted to commander and first officer in the non-canon 2007 novel Resistance, and continues to serve in this role in the Destiny, Typhon Pact, and The Fall novels. Later promoted to captain in 2379 and transferred with his wife, ship's counselor Commander Deanna Troi, to take command of the USS Titan. He was transferred to the Enterprise-E after the Enterprise-D was destroyed in The Next Generation spin-off movie Star Trek Generations. However, the crew are unaware that some of the Borg had teleported to the Enterprise before their vessel was destroyed. Depiction\nThe Enterprise-E is a Sovereign class starship, launched in 2372 from the San Francisco Fleet Yards under the command of Captain Jean-Luc Picard, and most of the key officers from the Enterprise-D. Origin and design\nRonald D. Moore, the co-writer of Star Trek Generations and Star Trek: First Contact, has suggested that construction of the Enterprise-E began during the final season of The Next Generation (2370), and that the ship was renamed USS Enterprise, which would become the next flagship of the United Federation of Planets after the Enterprise-D had been destroyed. After that, the crew witness Cochrane's flight and humanity's successful first contact, then Commander Geordi La Forge, the ship's Chief Engineer, informs Picard that he has found a way to replicate the Borg's temporal vortex and return to their own time in the 24th century, which he successfully accomplishes and the film ends as the Enterprise travels into the vortex back to the future. Lieutenant Commander Data (operations officer), an android who serves as operations officer from its launch in 2372, and was third in line of command, until his death in 2379, at the end of Star Trek: Nemesis. The Enterprise's crew briefly glimpse the result of the creation of this alternate history while following the vessel back through time; the attack is successful and Earth is wholly assimilated by the Borg. Lieutenant Reginald Barclay,  present during the events of Star Trek: First Contact. Commander William Thomas Riker (executive officer), first officer of the Enterprise from its launch in 2372. Lieutenant Hawk, Helm officer until assimilation by the Borg and death at the hands of Worf in Star Trek: First Contact. It appears in the films Star Trek: First Contact, Star Trek: Insurrection and Star Trek: Nemesis, where it serves as the primary setting. In the film Star Trek: First Contact, the Enterprise participates in the Battle of Sector 001, a Borg attack directly on Earth, the capital of the Federation, using a Borg Cube. Reception\nIn 2018, Io9/Gizmodo ranked the fictional spacecraft design shown in the films First Contact, Insurrection, and Nemesis, the Enterprise-E, as the third best version of starship Enterprise of the Star Trek franchise. This leads to the crew now realizing that the Borg's reason for time-travelling was to stop the first contact event and they decide to covertly assist Cochrane in his preparations in a bid to ensure the flight happens as intended and history remains intact. The USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E), or Enterprise-E, to distinguish it from other vessels with the same name, is a fictional starship belonging to the United Federation of Planets, commonly known as the Federation, in the Star Trek franchise. It is the sixth Federation starship to carry t"", 'From The Mauritius Command:\nThe Mauritius Command is the fourth naval historical novel in the Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O\'Brian, first published in 1977. Mr Seymour: Second lieutenant in HMS Boadicea, acting first lieutenant after Akers parts company. A messenger vessel, with Maturin aboard, reaches La Réunion to inform Aubrey of the losses and the failed attack on Port South East. A review written at first publication found the novel to be written in ""language deep with detail and the poetry of fact"", appreciating the period detail. Captain Corbett re-joins at Saint Denis in command of HMS Africaine. General Abercrombie: Commander of the invasion army, takes command over Keating. Mr Trollope: Third lieutenant in HMS Boadicea, acting second after Akers parts company. A small group of transports under the command of Captain Pym puts soldiers on Mauritius to garrison the fortress. Not long after embarking, they meet the French ship Hébé escorting a captured merchant ship. Mr Lemuel Akers: First lieutenant in HMS Boadicea, detached to sail HMS Hyaena to Gibraltar. Given command of HMS Boadicea, he is appointed commodore of a fleet intended to capture Mauritius and La Réunion during the story. After contacting Tom Pullings, who has moved the guns of Windham aboard Emma, Jack believes his fortunes have changed. Captain Lucius Curtis: Captain of HMS Magicienne, joins the convoy after chasing Vénus, which took more merchant ships. Mr Johnson: Master\'s mate in HMS Boadicea, acting lieutenant after Akers parts company, appointment confirmed at Cape Town. Suddenly the Emma signals the Boadicea that many other British sails are on the horizon, and Jack realizes Admiral Bertie has arrived to supersede his command. Plot summary\nFour years after the events of HMS Surprise, Jack Aubrey and Sophia Williams are married and the parents of twin girls. He then opens Bertie\'s letter ordering him to join the fleet at Rodrigues, where he will command HMS Illustrious, and the Army led by General Abercrombie. Major themes\nThe novel gives further scope to Maturin\'s role as both a secret agent (in which he uses propaganda effectively to support the British campaign) and as a naturalist (in which he is seen collecting relics of the extinct dodo and solitaire), while Aubrey for the first time experiences naval battles as the ""looker-on"" while others are directly in the fight. For the first 2,000 miles of the voyage to the islands, Jack switches his pendant to the elderly 64-gun ship of the line HMS Raisonnable. La Réunion capitulates almost without loss after simultaneous landings by army troops and sepoys from the British East India Company on both sides of the island. She was in her sixties during the time period depicted in the novel. He enjoyed the happy ending of Master and Commander and was grateful for more, including ""a complex and fascinating successor [which] appeared -- The Mauritius Command."" It was among the many re-issued in paperback by W W Norton in 1990–1991, 14 years after its initial publication by Collins (note list above). Many of the historical figures involved in the campaign are characters in the novel. The novel\'s ""peculiar narrative structure"" suggests climaxes that do not happen. The final invasion of Mauritius, based on Aubrey and Keating\'s original plan, is an overwhelming victory, and the French surrender after being given honourable terms. Mr Fortescue: Captain of the schooner Wasp and a man fond of birds, spent a long time with the albatross, shares specimens with Maturin after carrying him ashore on La Réunion. Corbet was killed under controversial circumstances during the action of 13 September 1810, which is depicted accurately in the novel. The process of reissuing the novels prior to this novel and The Letter of Marque was in full swing in 1991, as the whole series gained a new and wider audience, as Mark Howowitz describes in writing about The Nutmeg of Consolation, the fourteenth novel in the series and initially published in 1991. The convoy is caught in a major tropical cyclone, whence it sails back to Cape Town for repairs, receiving the first mail in many months; Sophia\'s letters are water-damaged and Jack tries to make sense of them. Others writing at that time saw the novel more as part of the longer series, with humour, erudition and ""impeccable period detail"". Their names are Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin, and their creator is a 77-year-old novelist named Patrick O\'Brian, whose 14 books about them have been continuously in print in England since the first, ""Master and Commander,"" was published in 1970. In the novel, Aubrey is appointed directly by the Admiralty thanks to Maturin\'s persuasion, as Maturin had been at work on the intelligence side of the project. Jack is given command of the 38-gun frigate HMS Boadicea and requested to depart immediately for Plymouth, where he picks up Mr R T Farquhar, a diplomat, and receives further orders to sail to the British station at Cape Town, where the ships of a conv', 'From Ship of fools:\nIn literary and artistic compositions of the 15th and 16th centuries, the cultural motif of the ship of fools also served to parody the ""ark of salvation"", as the Catholic Church was styled. Images of the ship became popular, especially in German-speaking lands, especially after the publication of Sebastian Brant\'s satirical book Ship of Fools (1494), which served as the inspiration for Hieronymus Bosch\'s painting, Ship of Fools. The ship of fools (Modern German: Das Narrenschiff, Latin: Stultifera Navis), is an allegory, first appearing in Book VI of Plato\'s Republic, about a ship with a dysfunctional crew. They throng about the captain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble captain\'s senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores; thus, eating and drinking, they proceed on their voyage in such a manner as might be expected of them. Him who is their partisan and cleverly aids them in their plot for getting the ship out of the captain\'s hands into their own whether by force or persuasion, they compliment with the name of sailor, pilot, able seaman, and abuse the other sort of man, whom they call a good-for-nothing; but that the true pilot must pay attention to the year and seasons and sky and stars and winds, and whatever else belongs to his art, if he intends to be really qualified for the command of a ship, and that he must and will be the steerer, whether other people like or not, the possibility of this union of authority with the steerer\'s art has never seriously entered into their thoughts or been made part of their calling. A woodcut illustration to an edition of 1584 of Brant\'s book shows the Anti-Christ sitting on top of the overturned Narrenschiff, while in the foreground Saint Peter guides a small boat of respectably-dressed men safely to shore. The allegory is intended to represent the problems of governance prevailing in a political system not based on expert knowledge. In it, Brant conceives Saint Grobian, whom he imagines to be the patron saint of vulgar and coarse people. ""Ship of Fools"" has continued to be used into the 20th century as the title for numerous books, songs and other works. The sailors are quarrelling with one another about the steering -- every one is of opinion that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of navigation and cannot tell who taught him or when he learned, and will further assert that it cannot be taught, and they are ready to cut in pieces any one who says the contrary. Normally, the images show a ship crowded with men mostly wearing traditional jester or fool\'s costume with cloth horns ending in bells, many quarreling, drinking, and fighting. In the book a ship—an entire fleet at first—sets off from Basel, bound for the Paradise of Fools. A ""complex political satire"", whose composition was repeated in at least seven different 15th-century prints, indicating great popularity, shows Pope Paul II and the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick III wrestling at the top of a ship\'s mast, wearing only briefs and their respective Papal tiara and crown. Emblems and labels cover many other European powers; the allegory is of the political fall-out from meetings between the two men in 1468-69. After the Protestant Reformation, some depictions took a sectarian turn. Some German cities have modern public sculptures of the subject: a fountain by Jürgen Weber in Nuremberg (1980s), a sculptural group in Neuenburg am Rhein (2004), a fountain in Cologne, and one in Bräunlingen of the shipwrecked boat. Benjamin Jowett\'s translation of Plato\'s text\n\nBenjamin Jowett\'s 1871 translation recounts the story as follows:\n\nImagine then a fleet or a ship in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew, but he is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight, and his knowledge of navigation is not much better. Now in vessels which are in a state of mutiny and by sailors who are mutineers, how will the true pilot be regarded? Will he not be called by them a prater, a star-gazer, a good-for-nothing? == References ==']",7,"This context does not mention when the first vessel Stephen Etnier commanded was constructed, only that it was constructed after the novel that inspired him to pursue painting was published.",-0.0013319700956344604,False,6,

Games owning the assets of Midway Games - announced that Ruben Fleischer was brought on board to direct. Untitled Minecraft album: C418, who was originally the sole producer of Minecraft\'s original soundtrack, has been planning to release a third soundtrack album as a follow-up to 2011\'s Minecraft - Volume Alpha and 2013\'s Minecraft - Volume Beta. The Dark Tower: An adaptation of The Dark Tower had been in development since at least 2007. Fear Inoculum: Tool frontman Maynard James Keenan announced at the 50th Grammy Awards in February 2008 that the band would start working on a follow-up to their 2006 album 10,000 Days ""right away"". Despite some speculation on a potential revival of the Good-Ass Job project during the making of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, no information came out regarding the termination or continuation of the album. Shortly before the film\'s initially planned 1984 theatrical release, a test screening of the rough cut of the film was held at the studio, but was met with negative feedback that claimed it was too intense and disturbing for the majority of the children in the audience, particularly during the climactic \'Cauldron Born\' sequence. The film was released on that date to positive reviews and became the ninth highest-grossing film of 2016 worldwide, as well as the highest-grossing R-rated film of all time, until it was surpassed by its own sequel, Deadpool 2, which itself was later surpassed by the film Joker. American McGee\'s Alice: A film adaptation based on the dark fantasy video game that is loosely based on Lewis Carroll\'s Alice\'s Adventures in Wonderland was in development prior to the game\'s release. Where the Wild Things Are: A film adaptation of the Maurice Sendak children\'s book of the same name that was in development since 1983, being tossed around to various studios, starting at Disney as a traditionally hand-drawn animated adaptation directed by John Lasseter in 1988. Years later, Michael Reaves revised the concept as Dark Planet or Planet and it would have had a story much darker than its source material complete with a post-apocalyptic time period but the script was lost when Turner and Warner Bros. merged in 1996. In addition, in March 2020, photos during the shooting were leaked as Warner Bros. characters outside the Looney Tunes franchise would also appear in the film, such as Superman, Batman, Pennywise, Scooby-Doo and Shaggy, Harry Potter, Joker, Gollum, Bane, Scorpion and Sub-Zero, Agent Smith, Mad Max, Finn and Jake, The Mask, the Gremlins, Tom and Jerry, Austin Powers, King Leonidas, George the Gorilla, Dr. Manhattan, Harold and Kumar, Yakko, Wakko, and Dot, Rick and Morty among others. If released, it will be X Japan\'s first album of new material in two and a half decades, their first since reuniting in 2007, their first to feature newest member Sugizo, and their final album with longtime bassist Heath, after his death in 2023. In the process, the screenplay went through so many revisions that the shooting script only loosely resembled the book, and writers later ""borrowed"" elements from the book to improve the film. Shane Acker was set to direct the film with the film now being titled The Adventures of Thomas and Wētā FX was doing the visuals for the film. Donner wanted the film to reboot the character of Deadpool, ignoring the version in X-Men Origins: Wolverine and including attributes that the character has in the comics, such as breaking the fourth wall. Filming at the time was anticipated to begin by the end of the year. The film was the only film in the franchise to receive a PG-13 rating. Lisa Henson was the producer of the biopic while Michael Mitnick wrote the script. The first draft of the script was complete under the name of ""TR3N"". In 2016, Zemeckis said that the sequel moves the story of Roger and Jessica into the next few years thus moving on from film noir to the world of the 1950s. Eisner finally gave the green-light to the film in 1991, and had Disney serve as executive producer on the basis that its production was funded by the proceeds from the video sales. The proposed film would have followed the comic story line known as The Death of Superman. Towards the end of the year, the band\'s reformation was publicly announced, alongside the album\'s release date of 24 June 2022. Spy Hunter: Since the summer of 2003, Universal Pictures acquired the rights to the 1983 arcade game of the same name from Midway Games. The crew at Dimension Films were shown footage of the game and were impressed with the visuals. Following the failure of the add-on, the media format of the game was shifted to a standard N64 cartridge before the development team\'s inexperience with 3D-oriented video game creation and a large series of delays led to the game being quietly cancelled in 2000. The COVID-19 Pandemic, reshoots, and director changes were the cause of the film\'s development hell. The Simpsons Movie: The idea f', 'From Robert Black (serial killer):\nHe was also a target for bullying among children his own age, and became a bully towards younger children. At the age of five, Black and a girl the same age compared their genitalia, triggering a childhood belief within Black that he should have been born female, and he developed a deep interest in his genitalia, the genitals of female children, and body orifices. Disappeared from the grounds of her comprehensive school; her fully clothed body was found in Hounslow Heath two days after her disappearance. Both reports were uncompromising regarding Black\'s deviancy and proclivities towards children. Adolescence\nBlack was placed in a mixed-sex children\'s home on the outskirts of Falkirk. Death\nBlack died from a heart attack at HMP Maghaberry on 12 January 2016, at the age of 68. From the age of eight he would regularly insert objects in his own anus, a practice he carried into adulthood. The meeting assessed the evidence investigators had assembled to establish whether Black had killed other children. Black claimed that on his long-distance deliveries he would pull into a lay-by and dress in the children\'s clothing before masturbating; he gave no plausible explanation for the sexual aids. He also said that Black accepted that he was a danger to children and wished to undergo treatment. Further evidence presented at trial included a salary ledger proving Black had been paid £50, which had only been given to drivers from his firm who made deliveries to Northern Ireland, and an order book confirming a delivery of billboard posters had been due to take place near Ballinderry on the date of the abduction. Also found were several items of children\'s clothing, six pairs of spectacles, a semen-stained copy of a Nottingham newspaper detailing the 1988 attempted abduction of Teresa Thornhill, and a variety of sex aids. For the HOLMES database, investigators concluded only those with convictions for serious sexual offences against children would warrant further investigation. Black also owned over a dozen pairs of spectacles, and would wear a pair significantly different from those he regularly wore when abducting children. In his final address, Judge Macpherson implored the jury to discard any emotion or personal distaste for Black\'s extensive history of sexual offences against children when considering their verdict, and not to prejudge his guilt because of his 1990 conviction for the abduction and sexual assault of the Stow schoolgirl. As Black was a keen photographer, he sometimes also discreetly photographed children (mostly girls between eight and twelve) at locations such as swimming pools; he stored these images alongside his pornographic material in locked suitcases. While working as a driver, Black developed a thorough knowledge of much of the British road network, subsequently enabling him to snatch children across the entire country and dispose of their bodies hundreds of miles from the site of their abduction. Clark further explained he could not recall any other cases where children had been abducted, killed and their bodies transported considerable distances, before stating: ""I don\'t believe there has been a bigger crime investigation in the United Kingdom, ever."" Sentencing Black to life imprisonment for what he described as ""a horrific, appalling case"", Ross said he was greatly influenced by the opinion of the psychiatrists, who had concluded that Black was, and would remain, an extreme danger to children. Immediately following these convictions, the more than 20 detectives involved in the manhunt who had been present at his sentencing addressed the press assembled outside the Moot Hall, with Hector Clark stating: ""The tragedy is these three beautiful children who should never have died. In the six-hour interview, Black freely discussed his early sexual experiences, his experimentation with various forms of self-abuse, and his attraction towards young children; he also described his penchant for wearing young girls\' clothing, and admitted to having sexually assaulted in excess of 30 young girls between the 1960s and 1980s. Herkes ran to the girl\'s home; the girl\'s mother called police. Wyre summarised the psychology behind Black\'s refusal to cooperate with investigators: He\'s the sort of person for whom it\'s all about power and control. Circumstantial evidence attesting to Black\'s guilt of Cardy\'s murder had been obtained by Northern Ireland investigators searching through petrol receipts—560,000 in total—stored in his former employer\'s archives, to ascertain Black\'s whereabouts on the dates surrounding the abduction and murder. She made a direct appeal to her daughter\'s abductor to reveal the whereabouts of her daughter\'s body, stating: ""I just want her back, even if she\'s dead. That\'s the same van!""

He played a fictionalized version of Wilhelm Grimm alongside Heath Ledger in Terry Gilliam\'s fantasy adventure The Brothers Grimm (2005), which was a critically panned commercial failure; The Washington Post concluded, ""Damon, constantly flashing his newscaster\'s teeth and flaunting a fake, \'Masterpiece Theatre\' dialect, comes across like someone who got lost on the way to an audition for a high school production of The Pirates of Penzance."" Later, he made his film debut at the age of 18, with a single line of dialogue in the romantic comedy Mystic Pizza. He is an ambassador for ONEXONE, a nonprofit foundation committed to supporting, preserving, and improving the lives of children at home in Canada, the United States, and around the world. He co-starred as thief Linus Caldwell in the former\'s first installment, Steven Soderbergh\'s 2001 ensemble film Ocean\'s Eleven, a remake of the Rat Pack\'s Ocean\'s 11 (1960). Peter Travers of Rolling Stone was mainly impressed with Clooney\'s acting, but also found Damon\'s performance ""whiplash"". Damon\'s 2010 projects included Clint Eastwood\'s Hereafter and the Coen brothers\' remake of the 1969 John Wayne-starring Western True Grit. Entertainment\'s top ten Jimmy Kimmel Live! IndieWire praised Damon\'s performance as ""graced with a quiet softness that offsets the sheer volume of the character he\'s playing"". In 2014, he starred in George Clooney\'s The Monuments Men, and played the minor role of scientist Dr. Mann in Christopher Nolan\'s Interstellar. Waxman endorsed Damon\'s statement on Twitter hours later. Damon\'s attempts at leading characters in romantic dramas such as 2000\'s All the Pretty Horses and The Legend of Bagger Vance were commercially and critically unsuccessful. His next role was Steven Soderbergh\'s dark comedy The Informant! So, it\'s millions of dollars coming in to us."" Later in 2017, he starred in two satires, George Clooney\'s 1950s-set Suburbicon, which was released in October, and Alexander Payne\'s comedy Downsizing, which was released in December. In 2021, Damon starred in Tom McCarthy\'s crime drama Stillwater, playing an unemployed oil rig worker from Oklahoma who sets out with a French woman to prove his convicted daughter\'s innocence. Among the company\'s projects was the short-lived mystery-hybrid series Push, Nevada. Damon\'s next film with frequent collaborator Steven Soderbergh was Behind the Candelabra, a drama about the life of pianist/entertainer Liberace (played by Michael Douglas) with Damon playing Liberace\'s longtime partner Scott Thorson. He doubted the film\'s financial prospects, but it proved a commercial success. The film, and Damon\'s casting, were not well received by critics. For the film, he earned an Empire Award for Best Actor; the award\'s presenter Empire attributed Damon\'s win to his ""astute, underplayed performance, through which he totally eschews movie star vanity"". Since 2015, Damon has promoted Anheuser-Busch InBev\'s Stella Artois beer brand as a Water.org partner, including the sale of limited-edition ""blue chalice"" glasses imprinted with an embellished blue version of the brand\'s logo. His major releases in 2004 included starring roles in the sequels The Bourne Supremacy and Ocean\'s Twelve. In her report, she suspected Lombardo of facilitating incidents of Harvey Weinstein\'s sexual misconduct in Europe. Damon said that he wanted to display his character\'s humanity and honesty on screen despite his criminal actions. He then played amnesiac assassin Jason Bourne in Doug Liman\'s action thriller The Bourne Identity (2002). At Harvard, Damon was a member of the Delphic Club, one of the university\'s elite Final Clubs. For his role, Entertainment Weekly named Damon among ""the decade\'s best mixer of brawn and brains."" In 2018, Damon bought a luxury penthouse in New York City\'s Brooklyn Heights neighborhood for $16.5 million. The two later parodied their roles from the film in Kevin Smith\'s 2001 movie Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. However, Damon clarified later that the calls were solely to reassure her of Lombardo\'s professional qualifications in the film industry. In Dogma (1999), he played a fallen angel who discusses pop culture as intellectual subject matter with Affleck\'s character. It marked the first release from Affleck and Damon\'s independent production company, Artists Equity, which they had formed in 2022. He also has a stepdaughter Alexia Barroso (born 1998) from Bozán\'s previous marriage, and considers her to be his own. In 2015, Damon portrayed the main character, astronaut Mark Watney, in Ridley Scott\'s The Martian, based on Andy Weir\'s bestselling novel of the same name, a role that earned him the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and his second Academy Award nomination for Best Actor. He was similarly deemed ""uncomfortable being the center"" of Robert Re', 'From The Dark Knight:\nChristopher described The Dark Knight as representative of his own ""fear of anarchy"" and Joker represents ""somebody who wants to just tear down the world around him.""

The consensus reads; ""Dark, complex and unforgettable, The Dark Knight succeeds not just as an entertaining comic book film, but as a richly thrilling crime saga."" Dent represents goodness and hope; he is the city\'s ""white knight"" who is ""pure"" of intent and can operate within the law. Although he was a fan of Batman (1989), starring Jack Nicholson as the Joker, Goyer did not consider Nicholson\'s portrayal scary and wanted The Dark Knight\'s Joker to be an unknowable, already-formed character, similar to the shark in Jaws (1975), without a ""cliché"" origin story. Alongside lead editor Lee Smith, Christopher took an ""aggressive editorial approach"" to editing The Dark Knight to achieve its 152-minute running time. Although The Dark Knight presents this as a heroic act, this ""noble lie"" is used to conceal and manipulate the truth for what a minority determines is the greater good. A sequel, The Dark Knight Rises, concluded The Dark Knight trilogy in 2012. The Dark Knight was available in sixty-two countries by the end of August, although Warner Bros. decided not to release it in China, blaming ""a number of pre-release conditions ... as well as cultural sensitivities to some elements of the film"". Describing his role as GCPD Lieutenant James Gordon, Oldman said Gordon is the ""moral center"" of The Dark Knight, an honest and incorruptible character struggling with the limits of his morality.

Sequel\nThe Dark Knight was followed by The Dark Knight Rises (2012), the conclusion of The Dark Knight Trilogy. A 2018 retrospective by The Hollywood Reporter said The Dark Knight taught filmmakers ""comic book characters are malleable.

Cypress Provincial Park was created in 1975 to protect the area from clear-cut logging. Local outdoor groups have criticized the ski resort operator of Cypress Mountain of restricting winter access to provincial park trails like the Howe Sound Crest Trail which passes through the ski area. The trail is located mostly within Cypress Provincial Park and is typically traveled as a single or multi-day hike from south to north, or as a means to access peaks along the route such as Mount Brunswick. The southern route from Cypress Mountain to the Lions, originally known as the Skyline Ridge Trail, was maintained by UBC students and Varsity Outdoors Club members in the 1960s and 1970s. It can be accessed in the south from Cypress Mountain Ski Area and in the north from the Sea to Sky Highway at Porteau Road, or via many intersecting trails that start at Lions Bay. It gets its name because it follows the crests of the North Shore Mountains that rise above the Howe Sound, the deep saltwater glacial fjord which parallels the trail to the west. The northern terminus of the trail between Porteau Cove and Deeks Lake is not part of the provincial park, but was on land owned by BC Rail, a crown corporation. Route description\nThe route begins in the south at Cypress Mountain ski area with the choice of two trails that both ascends the western slopes of Mount Strachan. The park was expanded north along what is now the Howe Sound Crest Trail to Deeks Lake in 1982. A federal grant expended the trail in 1983 from Deeks Lake to Harvey, and from Harvey to the Lions by the late 1980s. After traversing an exposed ledge below West Lion, the trail ascends Thomas Peak (1,540 metres [5,050 ft]) in the col between the Lions before descending a talus field to Enchantment Pass. History\nThe Howe Sound Crest Trail is located within the traditional territories of the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples who often used the mountains to hunt mountain goats. The next four kilometres (2.5 mi) follow the south and west slopes of Brunswick Mountain to the highest point on the trail (1,592 metres [5,223 ft]), with an option to ascend the 1,788-metre (5,866 ft) peak, before descending from Hat Pass to the Brunswick emergency shelter and a series of mountain lakes (Brunswick Lake, Hanover Lake, and Deeks Lake). Extensive trail work has already been done to connect the trails at Shannon Creek and the Sea to Sky Gondola to Mountain Lake near Sky Pilot group which is currently accessed from Furry Creek Forest Service Road. The trail, no longer officially maintained after this point, then descends steeply before an equally steep ascent to Unnecessary Mountain (1,548 metres [5,079 ft]) then traversing rocky terrain to the base of West Lion. Mentions of a hiking route from Deeks Lake to Brunswick Mountain area date as early as 1928. The trail is maintained by local outdoor groups like the BCMC in partnership with BC Parks. Future Extension\nThere is a long term goal of local outdoor groups like the BCMC to extend the trail north to Squamish, British Columbia. Upon reaching the logjam at the north end of Deeks Lake, it is a seven-kilometre (4.3 mi) forested descent to Highway 99 at Porteau Cove. In 2018, a quarry at Kallanhe Creek blocked the existing trail up to Deeks Lake and the trail had to be re-routed along Bertram Creek to preserve access. In 2017, development company Concord Pacific took ownership of the land. This trail was later upgraded to a gravel logging road in the 1960s. There were plans to develop the land into a town of 1,400 residences which never came to fruition. It is typically traveled between July and October due to high avalanche danger and elevated risk during winter conditions, which persist well into the spring. HSCT East is more direct, but HSCT West provides an optional detour to Bowen Lookout around two kilometres (1.2 mi) into the trail. Evidence of First Nations use has been documented along the trail, including 350-400 year old bark-stripping scars on old-growth yellow cedar trees above Yew Lake. A trail from Porteau Cove to Deeks Lake was built in the early 20th century to service a hydroelectric dam which provided electricity to Porteau Cove. At this point, the trail gets more rugged and technical, often resembling a scramble more than a hike with exposed terrain and several roped or chain-assisted sections.

Beginning in the summer of 2005, Cypress Mountain Resort has created a lift-assisted mountain bike park, as set out in the 1997 Cypress Provincial Park Master Plan. Etymology\nThe name Cypress refers to the tree Cupressus nootkatensis, also known as yellow cedar or yellow cypress, which is common in the park at altitudes over 800 metres. Cypress Provincial Park was granted Class A Provincial Park status in 1975. Trails on Cypress are known as being steep, eroded, and very dangerous. By the late 1930s, Heaps Timber Company acquired timber leases in the Hollyburn and Cypress Bowl area. Cypress Provincial Park is a provincial park on the North Shore of Metro Vancouver Regional District, British Columbia. Major mountains in the park\nThe lower section of the park contains three main mountains that form Cypress Bowl. In 2010, Cypress helped host the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver where it hosted Freestyle Skiing and Snowboarding competitions. That being said Cypress does house some more easily ridable trails, still not easy by any means but more accessible. Public controversy forced the provincial government to set aside Cypress Bowl as a park reserve in 1944, after 40 hectares had already been logged. Even though the lift accessed biking has now been closed for Olympic preparations and they have not yet bothered to restore the trails Cypress still hold many non-lift accessed bike trails. For more information regarding trails on Cypress there are mountain bike specific maps that include many of the trails and is a great place to start for riding on the mountain. [citation needed] Public outrage caused the province to take over development of winter recreation, resulting in the creation of Alpine and Nordic skiing facilities in 1970 and the construction of Cypress Bowl Road in 1973. These Trails on Cypress (Black Mountain Side) are known around the world for being some of the most technically challenging in the world, more challenging than the other two shore mountains (Seymour and Fromme). With 53 downhill runs (beginner 23%, intermediate 37%, advanced 40%) and over 19 km (12 mi) of cross-country trails, Cypress Mountain is the largest ski area on Vancouver's North Shore. The expansion included a narrow ridge running from Cypress Bowl to Brunswick Mountain, along what is now the Howe Sound Crest Trail, and a valley of subalpine mountain lakes (Brunswick Lake, Hanover Lake, and Deeks Lake). Hanover\nWettin Peak\nCoburg Peak\nGotha Peak\n\n2010 Olympics\nA significant part of Vancouver's 2010 Winter Olympics was hosted by Cypress in February 2010, including the snowboard (half-pipe, snowboard cross and parallel giant slalom) and freestyle skiing (moguls and aerials) events, as well as the recently added Skiercross, which used the snowboardcross run, with some modifications. The park has two sections: a 21 km2 (8.1 sq mi) southern section which is accessible by road from West Vancouver, and a 9 km2 (3.5 sq mi) northern section which is only accessible by hiking trails. The two sections are linked by a narrow strip of park along the mountainous Howe Sound Crest Trail. History\nEvidence of Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations use has been documented in the park, including 350-400 year old bark-stripping scars on old-growth yellow cedar trees above Yew Lake. In 1918, James Nasmyth started a logging operation and built a  mill on Rodgers Creek which operated until 1923. In the 1920s, Hollyburn Mountain became a popular recreation area for hikers and skiers utilizing the old logging roads. In 1926, the Hollyburn Lodge was built on First Lake, becoming the first commercial ski camp on the North Shore when it opened as the Hollyburn Ski Camp on January 16, 1927. In 1933, the West Lake Ski Camp also opened. On January 17, 1951, the Hollyburn Aerial Tram (HAT) chairlift and HAT Inn opened near Hi-View Lookout. With rising popularity of skiing, nearly 300 cabins were built on Hollyburn Ridge by the 1960s. Clear-cut logging resumed in 1966, affecting portions of Black Mountain and Strachan Mountain. The controversy about logging in the park, under the oversight of the Social Credit government, was debated in the BC Legislature and reported on in the media. The pa"", 'From Cypress Hills (Canada):\nInterprovincial park\nCypress Hills Provincial Park – one of the six original provincial parks of Saskatchewan – was established in 1931. The highest point in the Cypress Hills is at Head of the Mountain in Alberta at 1,466 m (4,810 ft). Name\nThe Cypress Hills have been known by a wide number of Indigenous and European names throughout their history. Cypress Hills Interprovincial Park was created in 1989, which joined the two parks on either side of the provincial border. The many species of birds range from mountain bluebird and greater sage-grouse to the great horned owl and other birds of prey. In popular culture\nThe Cypress Hills region is featured in Saskatchewan-based country singer Colter Wall\'s 2022 single ""Cypress Hills and the Big Country"". The highest point in Saskatchewan is 1,392 m (4,567 ft), in a farmer\'s field in the Cypress Hills, at 49°33′N 109°59′W. The Cypress Hills are a geographical region of hills in southwestern Saskatchewan and southeastern Alberta, Canada. In the Canadian French spoken by the Métis, the pine is called cyprès, although it is not a true cypress tree. The Cypress Hills Massacre, a key event in Canadian history leading to the creation of the North-West Mounted Police, occurred in the hills when a group of American wolf hunters, known as wolfers, from Montana massacred an Assiniboine encampment. The English translation is Cypress Hills. Ecology\nDue to their higher elevation, the upper slopes and summit of the Cypress Hills experience cooler temperatures and greater rainfall than the surrounding semi-arid plains, and they support a flora and fauna that is much like that of the mountains south of the Canada–United States border in Montana and Wyoming. In 1951, it was extended into neighbouring Alberta. Fish in Elkwater Lake and other lakes and streams in the area include walleye, yellow perch, northern pike, several species of trout, and others. The plateau is capped by the resistant conglomerate and sandstone beds of the Cypress Hills Formation. During the 19th century Métis settled in the hills, hunting and often wintering there. During the Pleistocene, the top of the Cypress Hills was not overridden by the Laurentide Ice Sheet and remained unglaciated. Chinook winds can raise the temperature 5 °C (9.0 °F) in an hour, with it not being uncommon for the temperature to go from −10 to 20 °C (14 to 68 °F) in a 12-hour period. The highest snow depth recorded is 80 cm (31 in) on 28 February 1994. The remainder of the area is covered by mixed grass prairie, with fescue prairie in higher areas. The highest single day snowfall is 60 cm (24 in) which occurred on 28 May 1982. The Alberta portion of the Cypress Hills contains the tourist destination of Elkwater, a community with campground facilities located on the southern shore of Elkwater Lake. Climate\nCypress Hills has a subarctic climate (Dfc) bordering on a humid continental climate (Dfb) due to its elevation above the surrounding area. Geology and geomorphology\nThe Cypress Hills reach a maximum elevation of 1,466 m (4,810 ft), rising about 600 m (2,000 ft) above the surrounding plains. This makes the Cypress Hills the highest point between the Rockies and Labrador They are the remnant of a more widespread plateau, most of which has been removed by erosion. The Cree language name, in use at the same time, is manâtakâw, (spelled in a variety of anglicized forms including ""Mun-a-tuh-gow""), sometimes said to mean ""beautiful upland"" but more accurately referring to ""an area to be respected, protected, taken care of and/or taken care with"". Early Métis hunters, who spoke Métis French, called the hills les montagnes des Cyprès, in reference to the abundance of Lodgepole Pine trees. Summer days are mild to warm coupled with cool nights, while winters are cold and snowy with annual snowfall averaging 255.2 cm (100.5 in). Today the Cypress Hills are part of a major drainage divide that separates rivers that drain south to the Gulf of Mexico via the Missouri River system from those that drain to northeast to Hudson Bay via the Nelson River system. History\nHistorically the Cypress Hills were a meeting and conflict area for various Native Americans and Indigenous Canadians (First Nations) including the Cree, Assiniboine, Atsina, Blackfoot Confederacy, Saulteaux, Sioux, Crow, and others. There are fourteen species of orchids, including the Venus\'s slipper orchid and the striped coralroot orchid, which are found primarily in wooded areas and along the banks of springs and streams. The hills are part of the Missouri Coteau upland. The hills cover an area of approximately 2,500 km2 (970 sq mi). About 400 km2 (150 sq mi) or 16% of this area is an interprovincial park. An 1882 Blackfoot–English dictionary written by C. M. Lanning provided the Blackfoot language name I-kim-e-kooy, which translates as ""striped earth"" or ""earth over earth"".

Company founder Tiffany Gaines was rejected by Chase Paymentech services ""as processing sales for adult-oriented products is a prohibited vertical"" and was told that it was a ""reputational risk"" to process payment for condoms. The deal was therefore structured as an acquisition by the Bank of the Manhattan Company of Chase National, with John J. McCloy becoming chairman of the merged entity. Through the acquisition, JPMorgan became owner of the former accounts of Providian Financial, a credit card issuer WaMu acquired in 2005. In December 2000, the combined Chase Manhattan completed the acquisition of J.P. Morgan & Co. in one of the largest banking mergers to date. However, its most significant acquisition was that of the Equitable Trust Company of New York in 1930, the largest stockholder of which was John D. Rockefeller Jr. After closing nearly 400 overlapping branches of the combined company, less than 10% of its total, Chase will have approximately 5,410 branches in 23 states as of the closing date of the acquisition. Even though Chase entered the market organically as opposed to a merger & acquisition, they still had to receive approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency to open branches due to Chase\'s size as a whole. Chase had previously considered buying National City branches from PNC that were required for divesture following that bank\'s acquisition of National City in 2009, but were instead sold to First Niagara Bank (since absorbed into KeyBank); it had been speculated that PNC intentionally sold the branches to a much smaller competitor due to not wanting to compete with a ""Big Four"" bank in its home market. Merger as Chase Manhattan Bank\nIn 1955, Chase National Bank and The Manhattan Company merged to create the Chase Manhattan Bank. The bank merged with Chemical Bank New York in 1996 and later merged with Bank One Corporation in 2004 and in 2008 acquired the deposits and most assets of Washington Mutual. :\u200a23–26\n\nChase National Bank\nChase National Bank was formed in 1877 by John Thompson. Chase Manhattan Bank was formed by the merger of the Chase National Bank and the Manhattan Company in 1955. The FDIC sold the bank\'s assets, secured debt obligations and deposits to JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA for $1.888 billion, which re-opened the bank the following day. The bank was known as Chase Manhattan Bank until it merged with J.P. Morgan & Co. in 2000. History\nThe Bank of The Manhattan Company (New York) was founded on September 1, 1799, and continued under that name until 1955, when it merged with the Chase National Bank, which was founded in 1877; the merged bank was called The Chase Manhattan Bank. In 1969, under the leadership of David Rockefeller, the bank reorganized as a bank holding company, the Chase Manhattan Corporation. Mergers with Chemical, J.P. Morgan\nIn August 1995, Chemical Bank of New York and Chase Manhattan Bank announced plans to merge. In 2004, the bank acquired Bank One, making Chase the largest credit card issuer in the United States. For Chase Manhattan Bank\'s new logo, Chermayeff & Geismar designed a stylized octagon in 1961, which remains part of the bank\'s logo today. JPMorgan Chase & Co. had assets of $3.31 trillion in 2022 which makes it the largest bank in the United States as well as the bank with the most branches in the United States and the only bank with a presence in all of the contiguous United States. The merger between Bank One and JPMorgan Chase meant that corporate headquarters were now in New York City while the retail bank operations of Chase were consolidated in Chicago. As Chase was a much larger bank, it was first intended that Chase acquire the ""Bank of Manhattan"", as it was nicknamed, but it transpired that Burr\'s original charter for the Manhattan Company had not only included the clause allowing it to start a bank with surplus funds, but another requiring unanimous consent of shareholders for the bank to be taken over. This type of bank fraud is commonly known as Check kiting. A 1979 study titled ""The Significance of Bank Control over Large Corporations"" found that: ""The Rockefeller-controlled Chase Manhattan Bank tops the list, controlling 16 companies."" In May 2023, it acquired the assets of First Republic Bank. According to data from SNL Financial (data as of June 30, 2008), this places Chase third behind Wells Fargo and Bank of America in terms of total U.S. retail bank branches. :\u200a115\u200a That night, the Office of Thrift Supervision, in what was by far the largest bank failure in American history, seized Washington Mutual Bank and placed it into receivership.

In 2002, Pacific Century Financial Corporation was renamed Bank of Hawaii Corporation. The Bank of Hawaii Corporation (Hawaiian: Panakō o Hawaiʻi; abbreviated BOH) is an American regional commercial bank headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. Bank of Hawaii has the most accounts, customers, branches, and ATMs of any financial institution in the state (although First Hawaiian Bank holds a greater number of dollars in deposits). Lastly, in 1917, First National Bank of Paia merged with Lahaina National Bank and First National Bank of Wailuku to form Bank of Maui.

In 1922, the bank acquired First Bank of Hilo, which had four branches. Activities in Hawaii since 1971\nIn 1971, BOH formed a bank holding company called Hawaii Bancorporation. Its operations in New Caledonia included eight branches of subsidiary Bank of Hawaii-Nouvelle Caledonie and about 190 employees. Then he organized the First National Bank of Paia in 1913. Zion merged their purchase into their National Bank of Arizona subsidiary. In addition to its main office in Port Moresby, Bank of Hawaii (PNG) also had an office in Lae, PNG\'s second port city on the Northeast Coast. Activities on the U.S. Mainland\nIn its first expansion onto the continental United States, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired the Phoenix, Arizona-based First National Bancorp of Arizona with its five-office First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary for an undisclosed amount in 1987. BOH and Westpac both had 30 percent interests in Bank of Tonga and 42 percent interests in Pacific Commercial Bank. BOH turned over its 51 percent interest in National Bank of Solomon Islands to the government of the Solomon Islands.

International acquisitions\nIn 1998, BOH bought 5.4mn convertible notes of Bank of Queensland for $22 million as part of a strategic alliance giving rise to a true reflecting of the convertible note value into 49% ownership at that time. Ten years later, through its First National Bank of Arizona subsidiary, BOH acquired all four Arizona branch offices from Home Savings of America for an undisclosed amount in 1997 and merged those offices into First National while at nearly the same time changed the name of First National to Pacific Century Bank NA. In 1990, BOH as Bancorp Hawaii acquired FirstFed America Inc. with its First Federal Savings and Loan Association in Hawaii and First Savings of Guam subsidiaries for $141 million in cash. The bank consists of four business segments: retail banking, commercial banking, investment services, and treasury. Large drop in the firm\'s stock in early 2000 caused by bad loans and quick expansion outside of the firm\'s core business of Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa led to a change in management. Ten years later, BOH continued its international expansion by absorbing Bank of American Samoa, which the Navy had established in 1914. After 14 years on the Mainland, BOH decided to abandon their activities on the Mainland in 2001 by selling all 9 Arizona branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to Zions Bancorporation for an undisclosed amount and all 20 California branch offices of the Pacific Century Bank to U.S. Bancorp for an undisclosed amount', 'From First Hawaiian Bank:\nIn December, BNP Paribas completed its acquisition of 100% of First Hawaiian Bank and its parent company BancWest.

In 1918, Schwyzer troops were called up to join the Federal Army in suppressing striking workers in the canton of Uri, in Rapperswil and in the Zürich Oberland. The canton of Schwyz (German: Kanton Schwyz [ʃviːts] ; Romansh: Chantun Sviz; French: Canton de Schwytz; Italian: Canton Svitto) is a canton in central Switzerland between the Alps in the south, Lake Lucerne to the west and Lake Zürich in the north, centred on and named after the town of Schwyz. The SVP lost about 7.0% of the vote when compared to the 2007 Federal election (45.0% in 2007 vs 38.0% in 2011). The conservatives fought back with a platform of protecting the religion of most Schwyzer. When the Spanish flu broke out in the army camps many Schwyzer soldiers died. On 11 October 1531, Schwyz, Uri and Zug decisively defeated the army of Zwingli. On 23 November 1847 Federal troops defeated the Sonderbund at Gislikon and drove the Schwyzer army back at Meierskappel. Zürich urged Bern to declare war on the Catholic cantons (Schwyz and its allies Uri, Unterwalden, Zug and Lucerne). On 9 July 1386 a Confederation force from Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden met the Austrian army in the Battle of Sempach. The government had the difficult task of reunifying the canton and supporting the new federal government, which 75% of Schwyzer opposed. The central elements of the myth, the Swedish origin and the rescue of the Pope became central elements in the Schwyzer state mythos. In 1480, Heinrich von Gundelfingen collected a number of local legends into a book called the Herkommen der Schwyzer und Oberhasler (Traditions of the Schwyzer and Oberhasler) which claimed that the land had been settled by 6,000 Swedes and 1,200 East Frisians after they rescued the Pope from a barbarian attack in 400 AD. In response, the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Nidwalden raised an army of about 10,000 men led by Alois von Reding to fight the French. Even in the 14th century, the chronicles of the surrounding countries referred to the Confederation as Schwyzer or Schweizer (the modern German spelling). In the 15th century, Schwyz joined Uri and Nidwalden in attempting to expand south of the Gotthard Pass to gain the revenue from trade over the pass. The destruction and looting from both armies stripped the canton of food and ruined fields, causing hardship and death among the Schwyzer during the following winter. Eternal alliance\nPerhaps on 1 August 1291, the cantons of Schwyz, Uri, and Unterwalden entered into an Eternal Alliance: this would eventually become the Swiss Confederation. At about the same time, a wave of immigrants from Europe (mostly from Italy) moved into the canton and a larger group of Schwyzer emigrated to the United States. The Confederates of Schwyz — supported by the Confederates of Uri, who feared for their autonomy, but not supported by the Confederates of Unterwalden — expected the army in the west near the village of Arth, where they had erected fortifications. To help break the political power of the Inner Cantons, Uri (without the Leventina but with the Urseren), Schwyz (without March and Höfe), both half-cantons of Unterwalden, Zug, the Republic of Gersau and Engelberg Abbey were merged into the canton of Waldstätten. It is one of the founding cantons of Switzerland; Switzerland's name is derived from the name of the canton, and the flag of Switzerland from its coat of arms. For the history of the name, see Schwyz. The Swiss Federal Charter is on display in Schwyz. Northeast of the town of Schwyz is Einsiedeln Abbey. History\nPrehistory to the Roman era\nThe earliest traces of humans in Schwyz are from the Upper Paleolithic and Early Mesolithic, or about 12,500 BC. An excavation of the karst caves in the valley of the Muota river (Muotatal) revealed numerous sites, some dating to the Younger Dryas period (c.\u200910,000 BC). The alpine meadows at Bödmeren, Twärenen and Silberen were Stone Age hunter-gatherer camps. Ibex and red deer bones, along with charcoal, indicate that the animals were butchered and cooked in these camps. In 2009 the first Stone Age tool in the canton, a stone drill, was discovered. During the late Neolithic and early Bronze Age, a number of pile dwellings and other settlements developed around the lakes of the canton. The Hurden sites are related to the western Cortaillod culture (c. 4500–3500 BC). Sites on the island of Lützelau and the shore zone at Freienbach are eastern Pfyn culture (4000-3300 BC) and Corded Ware culture (2750-2450 BC). During the Bronze Age, several bridges were built between the promontory of Endingen in Rapperswil, St. Gallen and the settlements at Hurden. Over 200,000 posts and seven bridges have been discovered, along with several settlements and ritual sites. On the Schwyz side of the lake, ten different settlements from 4300-2700 BC have been discovered.

Since 1868, several monolithic human figures known as Moai have been removed from Easter Island and put in display in major Western museums such as the National Museum of Natural History, the British Museum, the Louvre and the Royal Museums of Art and History. The Museum: A Short History of Crisis and Resilience. The Birth of the Museum: History, Theory, Politics. The site dates from c.\u2009530 BC, and contained artifacts from earlier Mesopotamian civilizations. Open air museums: The history and future of a visionary idea. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g., museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. Keeping Time: The History and Theory of Preservation in America. The Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts (National Museum of Arts\'s Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. Some museums seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while others have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History Museum or local history organizations. History\nAncient\nOne of the oldest museums known is Ennigaldi-Nanna\'s museum, built by Princess Ennigaldi in modern Iraq at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. The 18th-century scholars of the Age of Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on ""organization and taxonomy"" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi. The Canadian Museums Association\'s definition: ""A museum is a non-profit, permanent establishment, that does not exist primarily for the purpose of conducting temporary exhibitions and that is open to the public during regular hours and administered in the public interest for the purpose of conserving, preserving, studying, interpreting, assembling and exhibiting to the public for the instruction and enjoyment of the public, objects and specimens or educational and cultural value including artistic, scientific, historical and technological material."" Since the establishment of the earliest known museum in ancient times, museums have been associated with academia and the preservation of rare items. Museums host a much wider range of objects than a library, and usually focus on a specific theme, such as the arts, science, natural history or local history. In the late 19th century, museums of natural history exemplified the scientific drive for classifying life and interpreting the world. For example, in the 1970s, the Canada Science and Technology Museum favored education over the preservation of their objects. Museums can also be categorized into major groups by the type of collections they display, to include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, science, technology, children\'s museums, natural history, botanical and zoological gardens. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item. Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. Another example among many others is the so-called Montezuma\'s headdress in the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna, which is a source of dispute between Austria and Mexico. Concurrently, as American colleges expanded during the 19th century, they also developed their own natural history collections to support the education of their students. – also available in English: Contemporary Museums – Architecture History Collections.

Mackenzie King was optimistic: ""Canada will remember throughout her history,  that these two symbolical figures found their place at the top of the National Memorial on September the 30th, the day of the signing of the 4-power agreement which averted another Great War."" In that respect, the dates ""1899–1902"" (of the Boer War) and ""2001–2014"" (covering Canadian involvement in the Afghan War) were added to the monument. In response to a statement by Murray MacLaren that the central column of Confederation Hall (the main entrance) of the new Centre Block already had an inscription noting the service of Canadians who had fought overseas, Mackenzie King said the inscription made reference to many other events in Canadian history and, as such, was never meant to act as a national war memorial; he elaborated: ""there is, as of yet, no monument of a national character in the capital of the Dominion"" and what the Cabinet proposed was ""intended to be a national monument in the national capital.""

It is thought that ""O Canada"" became the de facto national anthem after the King remained at attention during its playing at the dedication of the National War Memorial; George, though, was actually following a precedent set by his brother, Edward, the previous king of Canada, when he dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France in 1936. Since 1940, the National War Memorial is the site of the national Remembrance Day ceremony, organized every year by the Royal Canadian Legion for 11 November.

""The Maple Leaf Forever"", written in 1866, was a popular patriotic song throughout English Canada and, for many years, served as an unofficial national anthem. A series of four wars erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the Seven Years\' War. Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years\' War.

History\nThe call for a National Gallery\nThe late 18th century saw the nationalisation of royal or princely art collections across mainland Europe. Following the Walpole sale many artists, including James Barry and John Flaxman, had made renewed calls for the establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it had access to the canon of European painting. In 1897, the formation of the National Gallery of British Art, known unofficially from early in its history as the Tate Gallery, allowed some British works to be moved off-site, following the precedent set by the Vernon collection and the Turner Bequest. Only the façade onto Trafalgar Square remains essentially unchanged from this time, as the building has been expanded piecemeal throughout its history. While an 1853 Parliamentary select committee set up to investigate the matter cleared the gallery of any wrongdoing, criticism of its methods has been erupting sporadically ever since from some in the art establishment. Wilkins\'s building was often criticised for the perceived weaknesses of its design and for its lack of space; the latter problem led to the establishment of the Tate Gallery for British art in 1897. When the gallery purchased Holbein\'s Ambassadors from the Earl of Radnor in 1890, it did so with the aid of private individuals for the first time in its history. Nothing came of Wilkes\'s appeal and 20 years later the collection was bought in its entirety by Catherine the Great; it is now to be found in the State Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The MP John Wilkes argued for the government to buy this ""invaluable treasure"" and suggested that it be housed in ""a noble gallery... to be built in the spacious garden of the British Museum"". The Bavarian royal collection (now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich) opened to the public in 1779, that of the Medici in Florence around 1789 (as the Uffizi Gallery), and the Museum Français at the Louvre was formed out of the former French royal collection in 1793. The current director of the National Gallery is Gabriele Finaldi. The National Gallery at Pall Mall was frequently overcrowded and hot, and its diminutive size in comparison with the Louvre in Paris was a cause of national embarrassment.

The National Gallery was sponsored by the Italian arms manufacturer Finmeccanica between October 2011 and October 2012. The present building, the third site to house the National Gallery, was designed by William Wilkins. However, future expansion of the National Gallery may yet see the return of 20th-century paintings to its walls. In 2024, the National Gallery celebrated its 200th anniversary with a range of programmes, events, and collaborations. The National Gallery is an exempt charity, and a non-departmental public body of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Unlike comparable museums in continental Europe, the National Gallery was not formed by nationalising an existing royal or princely art collection. The North Galleries, which opened to the public in 1975, marked the arrival of modernist architecture at the National Gallery. The eastern half of the building housed the Royal Academy until 1868, which further diminished the space afforded to the National Gallery. Their first acquisition for the National Gallery was Velázquez\'s Rokeby Venus in 1906, followed by Holbein\'s Portrait of Christina of Denmark in 1909. They usually hold the position of associate artist for two years and are given an exhibition in the National Gallery at the end of their tenure. One of the most persistent criticisms of the National Gallery, other than of the perceived inadequacies of the building, has been of its conservation policy.

On 20 June, Oxfam announced it would release Stand As One – Live at Glastonbury 2016, an album of live performances from the 2016 Glastonbury Festival, in memory of Cox. In July 2016, organisers of the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs\' Festival, an event in Dorset celebrating the efforts of a group of agricultural workers to form a trade union, dedicated that year\'s event to Cox\'s memory. One day after the attack, Corbyn and Prime Minister David Cameron visited Birstall, where they joined locals to lay floral tributes to Cox. The Great Get Together was also supported by former British Prime Ministers John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron, all of whom who recorded a joint video paying tribute to Cox and urging people to celebrate her life. Musicians and festivalgoers at Glastonbury, held later that week, also paid tribute to Cox; at one concert Billy Bragg led the audience in a rendition of ""We Shall Overcome"" and was joined on stage by women wearing suffragette ribbons. David Cameron cancelled a planned rally in Gibraltar supporting British EU membership. On 20 June, Jack Buckby, a former member of the British National Party announced he would be a candidate in the by-election for Liberty GB. Owen Jones tweeted, ""The coverage of Michael Adebowale – one of Lee Rigby\'s killers – did not focus on his history of mental illness. Following the death, Union Flags on British public buildings, including the Palace of Westminster, Buckingham Palace, and 10 Downing Street, were flown at half mast. This horrific act is an attack on democracy and the British freedoms that Jo Cox worked so diligently and passionately to defend."" On 16 June 2016, Jo Cox, a British Labour Party politician and Member of Parliament (MP) for Batley and Spen, died after being shot and stabbed multiple times in Birstall, West Yorkshire. Only two British newspapers did not feature a picture of Cox on their front pages as her murderer was arrested: the Financial Times, which focused on the first autumn statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond; and the Daily Mail. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon described the news as ""utterly shocking and tragic news, which has left everyone stunned"". Earlier that year, Cox had written to the Committee praising the work of the civilian voluntary emergency rescue organisation known as the White Helmets, and nominating them for the prize. The incident was the first killing of a sitting British MP since the death of Conservative MP Ian Gow, who was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1990, and the first murder of a politician in the United Kingdom during an attack since county councillor Andrew Pennington was killed in 2000. In its print edition, the Mail placed its coverage of Mair\'s conviction on page 30, which prompted LBC radio presenter James O\'Brien to accuse the paper of double standards, saying the Mail ""has chosen to put the murder by a neo-Nazi of a serving British MP ... on page 30. Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo stated, ""This is a truly appalling attack on a serving MP working hard to serve her community. In November 2016, MPs and musicians collaborated on a version of The Rolling Stones song ""You Can\'t Always Get What You Want"" for release as a charity single in Cox\'s memory and to raise funds for the launch of the Jo Cox Foundation. The nomination was also supported by members of Canada\'s New Democratic Party, who urged Stéphane Dion, the country\'s Foreign Affairs Minister, to give his backing on behalf of Canada. Aftermath\nCox\'s death was the first killing of a sitting British MP since Eastbourne MP Ian Gow was killed by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1990, and the first serious assault since Stephen Timms was stabbed by Roshonara Choudhry in an attempted assassination in 2010. Rock group U2 paid tribute to Cox during the UK leg of their 2017 Joshua Tree Tour; lead vocalist Bono, who had worked with her on the Make Poverty History campaign, dedicated the song ""Ultraviolet (Light My Way)"" to her memory. Cameron said:\n\nThe most profound thing that has happened is that two children have lost their mother, a loving husband has lost a loving wife, and parliament has lost one of its most passionate and brilliant campaigners, someone who epitomised the fact that politics is about serving others. Mair had links to British and American far-right political groups including the neo-fascist National Front, the United States-based neo-Nazi organisation National Vanguard (the successor to the defunct National Alliance) and the English Defence League; he had attended far-right gatherings and purchased publications from the National Vanguard and other outlets, to some of which he had sent letters and expressed support for South African apartheid.

On 24 June 2017, Stormzy performed a chant of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"" to the tune of The White Stripes\' ""Seven Nation Army"" on the Other Stage at the Glastonbury Festival. In September of that year, after being presented with the Solo Artist of the Year award by Corbyn at the GQ Men of the Year Awards, Stormzy called Prime Minister Theresa May a ""paigon"", a Jamaican Patois word used to describe an untrustworthy person. The following day, 10 Downing Street issued a statement defending the Prime Minister. His debut album, Gang Signs & Prayer (2017), was the first grime album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart and won British Album of the Year at the 2018 Brit Awards. On 12 December 2015, Stormzy performed ""Shut Up"" during British heavyweight boxer Anthony Joshua\'s ring-walk for his fight versus Dillian Whyte. In November 2022, Stormzy announced a partnership with Adidas and ten other brands, including football clubs Manchester United and Fulham, as well as Sky Sports and Goal.com, for a programme called ""#Merky FC"", set to launch in January 2023 and aiming to increase the representation of Black and mixed-Black British people in the football industry, by providing long-term, paid professional placements at the brands involved in the initiative.

To the LGBQT community and my supporters and friends, my deepest apologies.He also attracted controversy on 7 October 2020, when grime artist Chip released a video of Stormzy and several others at Chip\'s house in June of that year. In the aftermath of the George Floyd protests, Stormzy issued a statement via his label, stating that he plans to donate £1 million a year for 10 years to charities, organisations and movements that are committed to fight racial inequality, justice reform and black empowerment in the United Kingdom. It generated a large amount of support, which made it enter the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart on 18 December 2015 at number 8, a week prior to the Christmas number-1 week, succeeding the chart position of ""WickedSkengMan 4"". An inaugural winner of the prize, Hafsa Zayyan\'s We Are All Birds of Uganda was published in 2021 by #Merky Books, and was shortlisted for the 2022 Glass Bell Award. Stormzy was recognised for both his contributions to music and his activism, landing him at number 5 in the Top 10 of the annual Powerlist in 2020, with an estimated net worth of £20 million in 2020.

Headliners Levellers set another record when they played to a crowd of as many as 300,000 people on their Friday performance, Glastonbury\'s biggest ever crowd as of 2010. Organisation\nSince 1981, the festival has been organised by local farmer and site owner Michael Eavis (through his company Glastonbury Festivals Ltd). Billie Eilish headlined the Friday night, making her the youngest Glastonbury headline act to date. On 20 December 2007, Arabella Churchill, an instrumental figure in the conception of the 1971 festival and since the 1980s area coordinator of the Theatre Field, died at St Edmund\'s Cottages, Bove Town, Glastonbury at the age of 58. Following the death of DJ John Peel in the autumn of 2004, the New Tent was renamed the John Peel Tent, in homage to his encouragement and love of new bands at Glastonbury. Glastonbury takes place on 1500 acres of farmland and is attended by around 200,000 people, requiring extensive security, transport, water, and electricity-supply infrastructure.

Tickets\nGeneral admission tickets for the festival went on sale on 19 November 2023. Background\nThe first teases of the 2024 line-up came in October 2023 prior to the ticket sale, when festival organizer Emily Eavis confirmed that the Legends slot performer was a female artist, and hinted that there could be two female headliners, after she had initially booked a female artist for the 2023 festival who pulled out and had to be replaced by Guns N\' Roses. The main television coverage was hosted by Jo Whiley, Lauren Laverne, Jack Saunders, and Clara Amfo, with additional online-only coverage from Huw Stephens and Deb Grant, and aired on BBC iPlayer and several BBC channels, including the newly-created ""Glastonbury II"" channel in addition to livestreams from each of the five main stages. ^ H.

In 1979 Churchill and Kerr were again in charge of the festival, and from then on her administration continued alongside Eavis and Kerr, along with the founding and leading of the charity Children\'s World and work as a fundraiser. Each year a NATO country is honoured, and invited to send a beautiful ""Azalea Queen"" as its ambassador. In 1971, Churchill played a major role in the development of the Glastonbury Festival. This was used to construct a new bridge, dedicated to Churchill\'s memory, at the Glastonbury Festival site. Arrangements following her death reflected her Buddhism, and included a parade and simple farewell on the final evening of the Glastonbury Festival in June 2008. Notes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nArabella Churchill: The first lady of Glastonbury"", The Independent Chased through London by a surprised press, she left instead for rural Somerset, where she helped lead the first full-scale incarnation of the Glastonbury Festival with Andrew Kerr, Thomas Crimble, Michael Eavis and many others. In 1967 she was ""Debutante of the Year"", appeared in January UK Vogue feature ""Youthquakers Face \'67"" photographed by Norman Parkinson, met the Kennedys and Martin Luther King Jr. in America, and was romantically linked, during 1970, with Crown Prince Carl, the future King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. Death\nOn Thursday, 20 December 2007, Churchill died at St Edmund\'s Cottages, Bove Town, Glastonbury, Somerset, aged 58. Festival organiser Michael Eavis, paying tribute to Churchill after her death, said: ""Her energy, vitality and great sense of morality and social responsibility have given her a place in our festival history second to none."" Her duties in the 2007 festival involved the booking and management of some 1500 separate acts. In 1979, she set up the children\'s area of the festival and also the theatre area. In 1971 Churchill was invited to represent Britain at the Norfolk International Azalea Festival in Virginia, established in 1953 after NATO\'s Allied command was established there. Until her death, she ran the theatre and circus fields. She also founded and was the director of the Children\'s World charity. Life\nChurchill was born in London to Randolph Churchill (son of Sir Winston Churchill) and his second wife June Osborne (daughter of Colonel Rex Hamilton Osborne), and was half-sister to Winston Churchill, who was born to Randolph Churchill and his first wife Pamela Beryl Digby, better known as Pamela Harriman. She appeared, at the age of two, in the portrait of Winston Churchill and his family which hangs in the National Portrait Gallery. She went to Fritham School for Girls, where she was Head Girl, and then Ladymede school, near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire. She worked at Lepra, the charity for people with leprosy, and then briefly at London Weekend Television. In March 1954, then four-year-old Churchill appeared on the cover of Life as part of a feature on possible future spouses of then five-year-old Prince Charles. She refused to go, indicating in a letter she believed in the goals of the peace movement, and was horrified by the Vietnam War. During the 1970s she embraced the alternative culture of the time, which included living for a time in a squat but later worked and lived on a farm. She granted a rare interview to Rolling Stone magazine. In 1972 she married Jim Barton, and in 1973 had a son, Nicholas Jake. In 1987 she met her second husband, a juggler, Haggis McLeod, and in 1988 they had a daughter, Jessica. She embraced Tibetan Buddhism through the teachings of Sogyal Rinpoche, author of The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying. She had developed a short illness due to pancreatic cancer, for which she had refused chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In 2010, Eavis received a donation from British Waterways of timber from the old gates at Caen Hill Locks in Wiltshire.']","Edward Heath, September 1970",The provided text does not specify the British Prime Minister during the year that the Glastonbury Festival was launched.,0.14421190321445465,False,6,

The live hour-long show aired weekdays at noon and featured comedy sketches, circus acts, cartoons, games and prizes before a 200+ member studio audience. McDonald\'s replaced Scott with other actors for their national commercials and the character\'s costume was changed. Brazilian characters were created for the Brazilian Bozo show, like Salci Fufu — played by famous comedian Pedro de Lara — and Vovó Mafalda, played by Valentino Guzzo. Del Grosso played Clank the Robot in a few episodes. His wife played Cousin Littlefoot, an Indian Maid Clown. Washington, D.C.\nWillard Scott played Bozo on WRC-TV from 1959 to 1962. One of them was Ray Rayner (Oliver O. Oliver on WGN-TV\'s Bozo\'s Circus), who appeared in McDonald\'s national ads in 1968. In between, kids would play games to win prizes (one of the most plentiful being a six-pack of Orange Crush), Mr. Whoodini would pick kids to assist him in magic tricks, and of course Bozo would provide comedy. Tom Matzell played Bozo, alongside Gene Sanocki as Bozo\'s sidekick Professor Tweetyfoofer. Also on the show was piano player Mr. Calliope, played by Wally Townsend. In the mid-1960s, Andy Amyx, performing as Bozo on Jacksonville, Florida, television station WFGA, was hired to do local appearances of Ronald McDonald periodically. With the clown\'s large success in Brazil, two more actors, Luís Ricardo and Arlindo Barreto, were hired to play Bozo for additional shows which ran from mornings to afternoons and more comedians were chosen to play Bozo in other parts of the country. The Boston show also occasionally featured Nozo the Clown, the brother of Bozo, played by Bill Harrington. On February 5, 2019, Larry Thompson, who played Mr. Whoodini, died at the age of 76. Dick Dyszel played the character on Washington, D.C. broadcast TV, WDCA channel 20, in the 1970s to millions of viewers. McNea played the character in a more genteel and subdued way than Harmon\'s playbook required, and McNea did the show without a live audience.

References\nExternal links\nRicardo Ellcock at CricketArchive (subscription required)\nRicardo Ellcock at ESPNcricinfo In the English winter of 1983–84 he played for his native Barbados, as he did again (albeit very briefly) in 1984–85. Worcestershire won the County Championship in 1988, but Ellcock only played four County Championship matches (one of which Worcestershire won) that year. His next match was against Scotland in the Benson & Hedges Cup at Mannofield Park, the first List A game to be played at the Aberdeen venue. However, his tour had barely begun before it was over: he pulled up after just a few balls in the nets, and when he was diagnosed with a stress fracture of his back he was forced to go home without having played a single match on tour. He played quite often in 1983, and ended the season with 25 first-class wickets at 37.24 and nine List A wickets at 17.88; the latter figure included 4/43 in a John Player Special League fixture against Kent, a career best that he equalled six years later for Middlesex. His career was seriously hampered by injury, and despite being picked to tour with England in 1989–90 he was forced into retirement shortly afterward. After his cricket career finished, Ellcock became a commercial pilot, and was the first black captain with Virgin Atlantic. Early career\nEllcock was educated at Combermere School in Barbados, Malvern College in England, British Aerospace Flying College Scotland and the University of Westminster in London (MSc Air Transport Planning and Management). After a couple of seasons of Second XI cricket, and immediately after taking 11 wickets in one such game against Warwickshire II, Ellcock made his full Worcestershire debut in a County Championship match against future employers Middlesex at Worcester at the end of 1982, still only 17 years old. He took three lower-order wickets and scored 0 in his only innings. Ellcock took one wicket and did not bat. In 1984 Ellcock picked up 29 first-class wickets, his highest in any one season, but his struggles with fitness meant that he never again approached that figure for Worcestershire. After several such seasons of struggle Ellcock moved to Middlesex for the 1989 season. Although he did not play until June, he managed his most productive summer: 32 first-class wickets at under 20 runs apiece, and 16 wickets at 23 in the one-day game. He matched his List A best with 4/43 versus Nottinghamshire in July in the NatWest Trophy, and a week later recorded his only five-wicket haul when he claimed 5/35 against Yorkshire in the Championship. Later cricket career\nThe England selectors were sufficiently impressed by Ellcock\'s form to call him up for the winter tour against West Indies. Ellcock missed the entire 1990 season, but returned to play a few matches for Middlesex in 1991. Despite evidence of a possibility of improving, such as match figures of 6–110 against Somerset, he was unable to make a success of his comeback and retired in mid-season.

Burnley and Norwich City have been promoted out of the Championship on four occasions, with five teams (Fulham, Hull City, Sheffield United, Watford, West Brom) having been promoted on three occasions. Birmingham City eventually finished fourth in the Championship that season, and would lose to fifth-place Blackpool in the play-off. The English Football League Championship, known simply as the Championship in England and for sponsorship purposes as Sky Bet Championship, is the highest division of the English Football League (EFL) and second-highest overall in the English football league system, after the Premier League, and is currently contested by 24 clubs. On 16 March 2010, npower were announced as the new title sponsors of the Football League, and from the start of the 2010–11 Football League season until the end of the 2012–13 season, the Football League Championship was known as the Npower Championship.

The current world champions are Manchester City, who defeated Fluminense 4–0 in the 2023 final. The final Intercontinental Cup, played by representatives clubs of most developed continents in the football world, was in 2004, with a relaunched Club World Championship held in Japan in December 2005. History\nOrigin\nThe first club tournament to be billed as the Football World Championship was held in 1887, in which FA Cup winners Aston Villa beat Scottish Cup winners Hibernian, the winners of the only national competitions at the time. Al-Ain was the first Emirati team to reach the Club World Cup final, as well as the second Asian team to reach the final in the 2018 edition. Since every confederation had, by then, a stable, continental championship, FIFA felt it was prudent and relevant to have a Club World Championship tournament. The competition was first contested in 2000 as the FIFA Club World Championship. The FIFA Club World Cup is an international men\'s association football competition organised by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport\'s global governing body. Auckland City have participated in the most editions of the tournament (11), while Al Ahly have played the most overall matches (25). Trophy\nThe trophy used during the inaugural competition was called the FIFA Club World Championship Cup. Inauguration (2000–2001)\nThe framework of the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship was laid years in advance. FIFA agreed with UEFA, CONMEBOL and Toyota to merge the Intercontinental Cup and Club World Championship into one event. On top, a football based on the 1998 FIFA World Cup ball, the Adidas Tricolore, can be seen. Official songs\nLike most international football tournaments, the FIFA Club World Cup has featured official songs for each tournament since 2005.

In 2005, the Intercontinental Cup was merged with the FIFA Club World Championship, and in 2006, the tournament was renamed as the FIFA Club World Cup. 2017 involved the likes of Real Madrid becoming the first team in Club World Cup history to return to the tournament to defend their title. Two of the four pillars had inscriptions on them; one contained the phrase, ""FIFA Club World Championship"" imprinted across. The final draw of the first Club World Championship was done on 14 October 1999 at the Copacabana Palace Hotel in Rio de Janeiro. The first attempt at creating a global club football tournament, according to FIFA, was in 1909, 21 years before the first FIFA World Cup. Manchester United legend Bobby Charlton, a pillar of England\'s victorious campaign in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, stated that the Club World Championship provided ""a fantastic chance of becoming the first genuine world champions."" Awards\nAt the end of each Club World Cup, awards are presented to the players and teams for accomplishments other than their final team positions in the tournament. Prize money\nThe 2000 FIFA Club World Championship was the inaugural edition of this competition; it provided US$28 million in prize money for its participants. The relaunch of the tournament in 2005 FIFA Club World Championship saw different amounts of prize money given and some changes in the criteria of receiving certain amounts. The Scottish Football Association, via President Willie Allan, wanted FIFA to recognise the competition in order to enforce football regulation; FIFA responded that it could not regulate a competition it did not organise. In 1983, the English Football Association tried organising a Club World Cup to be played in 1985 and sponsored by West Nally, only to be denied by UEFA. The opening up of the global market in football has changed the balance. The first edition saw a Cinderella run of host team Raja CA, who had to start in the play-off round and became the second African team to reach the final, after defeating Brazil\'s Atlético Mineiro in the semi-final. Knock-out tournaments (2005–2023)\nThe 2005 version was shorter than the previous World Championship, reducing the problem of scheduling the tournament around the different club seasons across each continent. The first time when the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3. Additionally, the economic benefits to the winning team are considered inferior to any Super Cup prizes. North America\'s best result was Mexican team Tigres UANL, which earned a second-place finish in 2020. Ironically, the Sunderland lineup in the 1895 World Championship consisted entirely of Scottish players – Scottish p', ""From FIFA U-17 World Cup:\nThe Lion City Cup was the first under-16 football tournament in the world. The FIFA U-17 World Cup, founded as the FIFA U-16 World Championship, later changed to U-17 in 1991 and to its current name in 2007, is the annual world championship of association football for male players under the age of 17 organized by Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). Following FIFA's then secretary-general Sepp Blatter's recommendation after he was in Singapore for the 1982 Lion City Cup, FIFA created the FIFA U-16 World Championship.

Asia has one tournament win (for Saudi Arabia in 1989), the only time that a team from this confederation has reached the final and the only time an Asian team won a FIFA tournament in the male category. Each team played the others in its group and the group winner and runner up qualified for the knockout phase. Structure\nEach tournament consists of a group phase, in which four teams play against one another and standings in the group table decide which teams advance, followed by a knockout phase of successive matches where the winning team advances through the competition and the losing team is eliminated. (Australia was runner-up in 1999 but at that time was in the Oceania Football Confederation). A corresponding tournament for female players, the FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup, began in 2008, with North Korea winning the inaugural tournament. The 2017 tournament which was hosted by India became the most attended in the history of the tournament, with the total attendance of the FIFA U-17 World Cup reaching 1,347,133. The winners of each of these mini-tournaments would qualify to a 'final four' tournament with 2 semi-finals, a third place match and a final to decide the FIFA U17 World Champions. Awards\nThe following awards are now presented:\n\nThe Golden Ball is awarded to the most valuable player of the tournament;\nThe Golden Boot is awarded to the top goalscorer of the tournament;\nThe Golden Glove is awarded to the most valuable goalkeeper of the tournament;\nThe FIFA Fair Play Trophy is presented to the team with the best disciplinary record in the tournament. The current champion is Germany, which won its first title at the 2023 tournament. The first edition was staged in 1985 in China, and tournaments have been played every two years since then. It began as a competition for players under the age of 16 with the age limit raised to 17 from the 1991 edition onward. Nigeria is the most successful nation in the tournament's history, with five titles and three runners up. Brazil is the second-most successful with four titles and two runners-up. Ghana and Mexico have won the tournament twice. This continues until two teams remain to contest the final, which decides the tournament winner. The losing semi-finalists also contest a match to decide third place. From 1985 to 2005 there were 16 teams in the competition, divided into four groups of four teams each in the group phase. From 2007 the tournament was expanded to 24 teams, divided into six groups of four teams each. The top 2 places in each group plus the four best third-placed teams advanced to the knockout phase. Competition matches are played in two 45-minute halves (i.e., 90 minutes in total). In the knockout phase, until the 2011 tournament, if tied at the end of 90 minutes an additional 30 minutes of extra time were played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if still tied. Starting with the 2011 tournament, the extra time period was eliminated to avoid player burnout, and all knockout games progress straight to penalties if tied at the end of 90 minutes. From 2025 the tournament will take place annually and will have 48 participating teams divided into 4 'mini-tournaments' of 12 teams. Each mini-tournament is divided into 3 groups of 4, with the winners and best runner up qualifying to a four-team knockout stage. Qatar was announced as host on 14 March 2024. Qualification\nThe host nation of each tournament qualifies automatically. The remaining teams qualify through competitions organised by the six regional confederations. For the first edition of the tournament in 1985, all of the teams from Europe plus Bolivia appeared by invitation of FIFA.

Almost as soon as these rescheduled finals did take place, the respective league champions Hearts and Sunderland met in Edinburgh on 27 April 1895, in a match about which the Sunderland Daily Echo commented In Edinburgh the match was billed as for ""The championship of the world""! The changing football landscape leading up to the outbreak of World War I was shown in the summer of 1914, when the English and Scottish cup holders – Burnley and Celtic respectively – were both on tour in central Europe, and a match between them was arranged in Hungary, with the \'Budapest Cup\' trophy on offer. Having lost this match, Hibernian are said to have advertised their August 1887 friendly against Preston North End (which they won 2–1) as \'The Association Football Championship of the World\' and thus claimed the honour; however, while Preston were emerging as one of the leading sides of the period and had beaten strong Scottish opposition in the form of Queen\'s Park and Renton in the 1886–87 FA Cup, the Lilywhites had lost in the semi-finals to West Bromwich Albion, who had lost to Aston Villa, who had beaten Hibs. a small pewter trophy – the only known physical prize from any of these matches – was commissioned (today displayed at the Scottish Football Museum) and a ""Champions of the World"" sign was erected at their Tontine Park ground (which did not survive its demolition in the 1920s). Queen\'s Park then took on the new FA Cup winners Wolverhampton Wanderers in Glasgow a fortnight later and won comprehensively 5–0,\nAs soon as new 1893–94 league champions were declared – Aston Villa and Celtic respectively – they met in Birmingham on 9 April 1894, headlined by the Scottish Referee as ""The Championship of the World"". Local newspapers are said to have reported this as a de facto world championship game, however, the Scottish publications The Glasgow Herald and The Scotsman reported on it in no grander terms or greater detail than several other cross-border challenge matches of that weekend and the similar meetings of previous years, acknowledging the participants\' status only in passing. It means a big effort on the part of the clubs engage, and given such brilliant football as that seen on Monday evening at Celtic Park, is worthy of three times the attendance that graced the meeting that evening."" The 1886–87 FA Cup was also the last edition in which Scottish clubs would take part, with Rangers reaching the semi-finals. That situation changed somewhat in September 1883, when Dumbarton\'s match against Blackburn Olympic in Scotland was referred to in multiple publications as the ""Championship of the United Kingdom"". In 1903 Hibs took the SFL title and Sheffield Wednesday won the Football League, while Rangers the Scottish Cup and Bury the FA Cup. Summary\nAccording to all known fixtures between eligible clubs. From the reports available, it appears Bury v Rangers was the final match between Scottish and English trophy holders in the early 20th century; by that point leagues had already expanded to fill more dates in the regular season calendar along with other commitments, while foreign travel was becoming more accessible in the close season for the leading clubs. With the cross-border matches at official level having ended, much attention was given in the press to the meeting of 1887–88 Scottish Cup winners Renton and 1887–88 FA Cup winners West Bromwich Albion in May 1888, with it being noted that unlike many English clubs, West Brom had only English players in their team, and therefore the fixture had a genuinely international aspect. Both clubs had lost matches on their tours, and any claim by Celtic to some kind of wider honour could ha', 'From 2005 FIFA Club World Championship:\nSix clubs were invited to take part in the tournament, one representing each regional football confederation.

The previous of these had been running as an annual tournament between the champions of Europe and South America since 1960; the latter had undergone just one tournament, the 2000 FIFA Club World Championship. As a result of this merger, the tournament was conceived as being smaller than the original Club World Championship, which had lasted two weeks, yet building on the one game format of the Intercontinental Cup. The matches were held in Tokyo\'s National (Olympic) Stadium, Toyota Stadium in Toyota, Aichi, near Nagoya and the International Stadium in Yokohama, where the final was played. The champions of the four ""weaker"" confederations played in the quarter-finals; the losers played in a fifth place play-off. The winners were then joined by the European and South American champions in the semi-finals; the losers played in a third place play-off. The tournament was held in Japan from 11 to 18 December 2005 and won by Brazilian club São Paulo, who defeated English side Liverpool 1–0 in the final. Background\nThe 2005 tournament was created as a merger between the Intercontinental Cup and the earlier FIFA Club World Championships. Venues\nTokyo, Yokohama and Toyota were the three cities to serve as venues for the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup. The competition\'s name, which was the simple union between the name of the two previous merging competitions, was evidently too long, and was going to be reduced the following year, becoming the FIFA Club World Cup. The 2001 tournament had been cancelled when FIFA\'s marketing partner ISL went bankrupt. To celebrate the marriage between the two competitions, a new trophy was introduced by FIFA.

Patrick Warburton was the first celebrity actor to join the film and did so purely out of a love for the script. Emmy-winning actress Sally Struthers was brought in to play Granny Puckett and Joel McCrary was cast as Chief Grizzly. The film was nearly complete by the time that the Weinsteins became involved, and Edwards has stated that nothing was done by them to ruin ""the original vision of the movie."" Bill Stork; Glenn Close replaced Sally Struthers in the role of Granny Puckett; Xzibit replaced Joel McCrary in the role of Chief Grizzly and Chazz Palminteri replaced Tom Kenny in the role of Woolworth the Sheep. Hoodwinked! is a 2005 American independent computer-animated musical mystery comedy film. It retells the folktale ""Little Red Riding Hood"" as a police procedural, using backstories to show multiple characters\' points of view. It was produced independently by Blue Yonder Films with Kanbar Entertainment, directed and written by Cory Edwards (in his directorial debut) (who is also the voice of Twitchy) along with Todd Edwards, and Tony Leech, and produced by Katie Hooten, Maurice Kanbar, David K. Lovegren, Sue Bea Montgomery, and Preston Stutzman. The film features the voices of Anne Hathaway, Glenn Close, Jim Belushi, Patrick Warburton, Anthony Anderson, David Ogden Stiers, Xzibit, Chazz Palminteri, and Andy Dick. Hoodwinked! was among the earliest computer-animated films to be completely independently funded. Working apart from a major studio allowed the filmmakers greater creative control, but also restrained them economically. Due to the film\'s low budget, its animation was produced in the Philippines with a stylized design inspired by stop motion films. The Weinstein Company did not sign on as the film\'s distributor until near the end of production, and while the company had several roles recast with higher-profile actors, it otherwise made few changes to the film. Structurally, the film was inspired by non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon and Pulp Fiction. It was released shortly after the first two installments in the successful Shrek series, which accentuated the fairy tale parody genre of which Hoodwinked! is a part. Hoodwinked!, however, intentionally deviated from the Shrek series in its style of humor and in certain plot elements. This was in part based on Cory Edwards\' concerns over exposing children to the high level of cynicism often found in the genre. The film was released by the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles, California, and Philadelphia on December 16, 2005, for a one-week engagement before expanding nationwide on January 13, 2006. Critical reception to the film was varied; although its script and voice performances were praised by many reviews, its animation quality was heavily criticized. The film was a commercial success, earning over thirteen times its less-than-$8 million budget. A sequel, Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil, was released in 2011 to negative reviews and failed to match the financial success of the first film. Plot\nRed Puckett arrives at her grandmother Abigail\'s house, where the Big Bad Wolf has disguised himself as Red\'s Granny. The Wolf attacks Red. Granny, who has been tied up, jumps out of a closet just as ax-wielding woodsman Kirk bursts through the window. The police arrive, and Detective Nicky Flippers questions everyone about the incident. Red explains she was delivering goodies for her grandmother\'s business when she discovered a threat from the Goody Bandit, who has been stealing recipes. Red had set out to take the Puckett family recipes to Granny\'s mountaintop home for safekeeping, but fell out of Bunny Boingo\'s cable car and encountered the Wolf, who asked her suspicious questions. Evading the Wolf, she met the old singing goat Japeth, who accompanied her to Granny\'s house where she found the Wolf waiting in ambush. The Wolf reveals that he is an investigative reporter on the trail of the Goody Bandit, and had reason to believe Red and Granny were the culprits. The Wolf and his hyperactive squirrel assistant Twitchy confronted Red in hope of solving the Goody Bandit mystery. When they failed to detain Red, they made haste for Granny\'s house, arriving ahead of Red via a shortcut known to Boingo. They found Granny already tied up in the closet. The Wolf disguised himself as Granny, planning to trick Red into revealing the truth about the Goody Bandit. Kirk explains his appearance at Granny\'s house was pure coincidence; he is an aspiring actor trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goody Bandit, he received a callback for the commercial and was told to \'find his inner woodsman\'. He spent the rest of the day getting into character by chopping trees, until at sunset a tree collapsed and pushed him through the window of Granny\'s home. The investigation turns to Granny, who is secretly an extreme sports enthusiast.

He is the only black child in South Park until the introduction of Nichole Daniels in ""Cartman Finds Love"" in season 16. Kyle is distinctive as one of the few Jewish children on the show, and because of this, he often feels like an outsider amongst the core group of characters. Clyde appears in the three-part story arc ""Coon 2: Hindsight"", ""Mysterion Rises"", and ""Coon vs. Coon and Friends"" as his alter-ego, Mosquito. In the Season 1 (1997) episode ""Tom\'s Rhinoplasty"" when Stan, along with the other boys, falls in love with an attractive substitute teacher, Wendy accuses her of stealing Stan from her, and eventually formulates a complex plan to get her thrown into the sun. He makes his first prominent appearance in the 1999 season 3 episode ""Tweek vs. Craig"" in which he tells everyone that both Tweek and Craig decided against fighting each other and went home instead. Creation and inception\nFollowing the success of the 1995 short Jesus vs. Santa, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone conceived a plan to create a television series based on the short, with four children characters as the main stars. In the Season 19 episode ""Tweek x Craig"", female students of Asian backgrounds started drawing homoerotic ""yaoi"" images of Craig and his classmate Tweek Tweak, depicting them as lovers, in contrast to their rival-like role in ""Tweek vs. Craig"". It is revealed in the season 14 three-part story arc ""Coon 2: Hindsight"", ""Mysterion Rises"" and ""Coon vs. Coon and Friends"" that Kenny canonically has an ability to resurrect after dying, though he is always the only one who can ever remember dying, despite his friends always bearing witness. In the first several seasons, Craig has a habit of giving people the finger, a trait the show\'s official website attributes to his learning the behavior from his family, all of whom frequently use the gesture as well, most notably in the third season episode, ""Tweek vs. Craig"", in which his entire family take turns flipping each other off at the dinner table. South Park is an American adult animated television series created by Trey Parker and Matt Stone for the Comedy Central television network. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys, Stan Marsh, Kyle Broflovski, Kenny McCormick, and Eric Cartman and their bizarre adventures in and around the fictional Colorado town of South Park. The town is also home to an assortment of characters who make frequent appearances in the show, such as students and their family members, elementary school staff, and recurring characters. Stan is portrayed as the everyman of the group, as the show\'s official website describes him as ""a normal, average, American, mixed-up kid."" Kyle is the lone Jew among the group, and his portrayal in this role is often dealt with satirically. Stan and Kyle are best friends, and their relationship, which is intended to reflect the real-life friendship between South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, is a common topic throughout the series. Cartman—loud, obnoxious, and obese—is sometimes portrayed as the series\' antihero and his antisemitic attitude has resulted in an ever-progressing rivalry with Kyle. Kenny, who comes from a poor family, wears his parka hood so tightly that it covers most of his face and muffles his speech. During the show\'s first five seasons, Kenny died in almost every single episode before returning in the next without explanation. Stone and Parker perform the voices of most of the male South Park characters. Mary Kay Bergman voiced the majority of the female characters until her death in 1999. Eliza Schneider (1999–2003), Mona Marshall (2000–present), April Stewart (2004–present), and Kimberly Brooks (2008–present) have voiced most of the female characters since. A few staff members such as Jennifer Howell, Vernon Chatman, John Hansen, and Adrien Beard have voiced other recurring characters. The series was originally set up at 20th Century Fox Television for its primetime premiere on FOX, which previously commissioned Parker and Stone to develop the short. However, FOX was not pleased with the show\'s inclusion of Mr. Hankey, a talking poo character, and felt it wouldn\'t bode well with viewers. The network\'s executives also said that placing kids as the stars could not be as funny and popular as it would with the grown-ups and families, like The Simpsons and King of the Hill. As a result, Parker and Stone broke off relations with FOX and took the series somewhere else. They pitched the series to MTV and Comedy Central, and decided it was best suited for the latter, fearing the former could turn it to a more kid-friendly show later on. Comedy Central agreed to pick up the series, and the premiere episode, ""Cartman Gets an Anal Probe"", debuted on the network on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey would debut in the tenth episode, ""Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo', ""From Estonia:\nIt is written in the Kalevala meter, a largely lyrical form of folk poetry based on syllabic quantity. Oskar Luts was the most prominent prose writer of early Estonian literature and is still widely read today, particularly his lyrical school novel Kevade (Spring). Small pastries called pirukas, filled with meat, fish, or vegetables, are also common starters, often accompanied by a light broth, or puljong, which complements their savory flavors.

Many folk tales are told to this day and some have been written down and translated to make them accessible to an international readership. In the 4th century, Gothic ruler Ermanaric claimed to have subjugated the territories corresponding to Estonia, but there is no archaeological evidence to support this. It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland across from Finland, to the west by the sea across from Sweden, to the south by Latvia, and to the east by Lake Peipus and Russia. It is bordered to the north by the Gulf of Finland across from Finland, to the west by the sea across from Sweden, to the south by Latvia, and to the east by Lake Peipsi and Russia. To enforce this, the Language Inspectorate was created to oversee compliance with the Language Act. By the time of the Great Northern War, many Estonians were loyal to the Swedish crown, with up to 20,000 fighting to defend Estonia against Russian invasion. Thousands of Estonians escaped to Finland, where many volunteered to fight together with Finns against Soviets. According to the WWF, the territory of Estonia belongs to the ecoregion of Sarmatic mixed forests. From July to September, the Soviet forces launched several major offensives, compelling German troops to withdraw. Cultural autonomies could be granted to minorities numbering more than 3,000 people with longstanding ties to the Republic of Estonia. Since the restoration of independence, Estonia has continued to experience urbanization trends, with many residents moving to cities. Due to its historical role as the unofficial language of the Soviet-occupied Estonia, Russian was compulsory in schools, leading many Estonians, particularly those aged 40 to 70, to speak it fluently. The Seima-Turbino phenomenon brought the first bronze artefacts to the region and is often connected to the development of the Finno-Ugric languages. In the 1930s, Estonian folk dance elements began to influence professional theatre productions and contributed to the development of Estonian ballet. During and after World War II, many Estonian writers fled to the West, while others relocated to the Soviet Union. This led to the formation of the Congress of Estonia, a grassroots parliament dedicated to achieving independence through legal continuity and sovereignty. Plans to renovate older units of the Narva Power Plants and establish new stations aim to enhance efficiency in oil shale-based energy production. While Estonia's logging practices need to be reduced to enhance biodiversity and achieve carbon sequestration goals, the sector continues to expand; in 2022, the state forestry agency RMK reported a record profit of 1.4 billion euros. However, inventories indicate serious over-harvesting, leading to intensified debates about how to sustain the timber industry while protecting Estonia's rich biodiversity. This blend of influences has earlier led Estonia to aspire to be recognized as a Nordic state, embracing both its unique identity and broader regional connections; however the pride in belonging to Eastern Europe has also grown in the 2020s. In June 1919, Estonia defeated the German Landeswehr which had attempted to dominate Latvia, restoring power to the government of Kārlis Ulmanis there. In 1989, the Estonian Citizens' Committees began registering citizens according to jus sanguinis – those whose citizenship traced back to the pre-war republic. The aim is to minimize and prevent future ailments for those whose genes make them extra prone to conditions like adult-onset diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. Linguistic reforms helped to develop the Estonian language. Some modern historians believe he was referring to Balts, while others have proposed that the name then applied to the whole eastern Baltic Sea region.

Lose Your Way (2011–2016)\nIn January 2011, Hewitt revealed he had begun writing the band\'s second album and that the band would commence recording after completing the supporting tour for their self-titled debut album. The album was followed by the ""Modern War Song"" and ""So Close"" EPs on 24 July and 6 November. Mixing began in September and continued for six months before the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in April 2009. The writing process for the album was completed in March 2012 and was recorded by Hewitt and Donald Ross Skinner, with Dan Austin producing. The band spent two days at Fisher Lane Farm in early August with producer Paul Corkett to record acoustic versions of nine tracks released on their self-titled debut album. The album was preceded by the ""Lose Your Way"" EP on 11 May, with the title track peaking at number one on the Deutsche Alternative Singles Chart. An acoustic version of ""Bring Me Down (You Don\'t)"" was given away by the band as a free download in advance of the release of the acoustic album on 5 December. On 9 April, Q Magazine made ""Swan Killer"" their Track of the Day and the band announced the album title as Lose Your Way, with a release date of 29 June 2015. Five months later, it was announced that Lose Your Way (Acoustic) (an album of acoustic versions of songs initially released on Lose Your Way) would be released on 2 September 2016. The album\'s supporting tour began on 24 November at the London Barfly and featured Gizz Butt (guitar) and Ravi Kesavaram (drums) as touring musicians alongside permanent members Hewitt, Skinner and Bamonte. Band history\nBeginnings and formation (2007–2009)\nUpon leaving Placebo after the conclusion of their Meds tour in September 2007, Steve Hewitt had a vision ""to create a new band, a new album and a new sound"". He immediately enlisted Lamb bassist Jon Thorne and his brother Nick Hewitt to begin writing and demoing new music at his home studio. In March 2008, Julian Cope collaborator Donald Ross Skinner was brought in to oversee and co-produce the recording sessions. Between April and August 2008, the collective moved to Moles Studio in Bath for three recording sessions with producer Paul Corkett, which yielded ten songs, with Hewitt predominantly performing drums and lead vocals. Hewitt spent the second half of 2009 securing management, publishing and record deals, in addition to finding permanent members for the band. Former Cure and Depeche Mode tour manager Daryl Bamonte became the band\'s manager. The band made their live debut at the Eurosonic Festival in Groningen, Netherlands on 14 January 2010, with guest bassist Jonathan Noyce. Bassist Magnus Lundén was added as a permanent member in time for the band\'s UK live debut at the Barfly in London on 11 May. The band followed up with a', 'From Lose Your Way (album):\nLose Your Way is the second studio album by the British rock band Love Amongst Ruin. Background\nWriting and recording\nWriting for Love Amongst Ruin\'s second album began midway through the tour supporting their self-titled debut album in January 2011. Hewitt subsequently joined Six by Seven for its Love and Peace and Sympathy album and tour in 2013 and produced records by former Love Amongst Ruin opening bands Lys and Spiral 69.

Reception\nNME gave the album 7/10, saying that the album was ""lovely, but ruinous"". Hewitt revealed that there isn\'t a constant theme running through the album, instead ""the album is more of a soundscape"". By April 2021, the album had gone silver. Former member Laurie Ross returned to provide cello and programming for the album. Perry Bamonte featured on bass on the album after being announced as having joined the band in September 2012. awarded the album 4/5, saying Hewitt\'s ejection from Placebo ""may well have been a blessing in disguise"". Cryptic Rock gave the album full marks and said Hewitt had achieved a ""smorgasbord"" and ""cornucopia of sound"". The Lose Your Way album title and track list were revealed in April 2015,> with a release date of 29 June 2015. Austin was given a trial run at producing the title track, which he ""nailed"" and was asked to produce the whole album. Themes\nOf the album\'s title and title track, Hewitt said ""it’s how your perceptions change as you go through life. A cover of Six by Seven\'s ""So Close"" was recorded for the album, prior to Hewitt joining the said band in 2013. In November, Hewitt revealed that the band had been recording at Moles Studio in Bath, the location of the majority of recording for the band\'s debut album. Despite initially not wishing to record a cover, Hewitt and Austin felt the track fitted the vibe of the album and set out ""to make it the song it never really was"". It was released by Ancient B Records on 29 June 2015 and has been described as ""an album from an artist over the hump, head high to the future and all engines gunning"". Early composition ""Oh God"" was recorded for the album, after having been performed live at the London Scala in June 2010 and prepared for an EP in 2012, which failed to see release. The release of the album was preceded by the ""Lose Your Way"" EP on 11 May 2015 and was followed by the ""Modern War Song"" and ""So Close"" EPs respectively on 24 July and 6 November. Hewitt also revealed that he consciously made a decision to write about experiences outside the personal nature prevalent on the debut album, saying ""it\'s a difficult thing to do and a huge departure mentally and it\'s something I find exciting. Just prior to the end of the tour the following June, frontman Steve Hewitt revealed that the band had written nine songs and planned to begin recording in September 2011. Writing was completed in March 2012 and recordings continued at Moles Studio, with Hewitt and guitarists Donald Ross Skinner and Steve Hove handling playing duties, with Paul Corkett engineering. Corkett later put Hewitt and Skinner in touch with producer Dan Austin, a frequent production partner of Gil Norton. The entire process was completed in two-and-a-half months. Hewitt recalled that the troublesome vocal melody for ""Menace Ballad"" was completed by local Bath musician Nick Walker. Do you actually know where you’re fucking going? It’s trying to explain life’s difficult path"". There are still personal songs on the record, but it\'s more about the human condition rather than what\'s being inflicted by others"". Closing track ""Oh God"" was written by Hewitt as a reaction to the shock of hearing the news of the death of his friend Stuart Cable in 2010. ""Modern War Song"" deals with the subject of Western imperialism and how ""revolting soldiers are treated when their service finishes after signing up and fighting for their country"". Delay and release\nLose Your Way was put on the back burner after guitarist Steve Hove quit the band shortly before a comeback show at the London Barfly on 10 September 2012. Kerrang! The tour included the band\'s debut shows in Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Norway and Sweden. Gizz Butt (guitar) and Ravi Kesavaram (drums) were brought in to support the core lineup of Hewitt, Skinner and Bamonte. An instrumental version of the off-album track ""Amy\'s Prayer"" was used as the band\'s walk-on music. Cancelled dates\n1 Cancelled due to circumstances beyond the band\'s control.

His comments were described as racist by some, including Maryland\'s Republican governor Larry Hogan. George Yancy, a professor at Emory University known for his work on racial issues, concluded that Trump is racist, describing his outlook as ""a case of unabashed white supremacist ideas."" ""), and David Leonhardt (""Donald Trump is a racist""). Trump has been called a racist by a number of New York Times columnists including Nicholas Kristof (""I don\'t see what else we can call him but a racist""), Charles M. Blow (""Trump Is a Racist. This is particularly surprising as the United States of America remains a global example of how migration gave birth to a nation built on strong values of diversity and opportunity."" On March 3, 2016, Trump stated: ""David Duke is a bad person, who I disavowed on numerous occasions over the years. Former grand wizard David Duke spoke calling the demonstrations a ""turning point"" saying, ""We are going to fulfill the promises of Donald Trump. On February 24, 2016, David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan Grand Dragon, expressed vocal support for Trump\'s campaign on his radio show. Although her 1940 census after her 1936 marriage to Fred Trump described her as a ""naturalized citizen"", Mary was only a Permanent Resident at that point, not becoming a full citizen until March 1942, four years prior to Donald\'s birth in 1946. Republican senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, also present at the meeting, initially issued a joint statement stating that they ""do not recall the President saying those comments specifically"". Reformed neo-Nazi Christian Picciolini, for example, tweeted that ""Trump\'s \'I\'m a Nationalist\' comment will likely represent the biggest boon for white supremacist recruitment since the film The Birth of a Nation glorified the Klan in 1915 and gained the KKK 4 million members by 1925."" Former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke praised Trump\'s remarks in a tweet: ""Thank you President Trump for your honesty & courage to tell the truth about #Charlottesville & condemn the leftist terrorists in BLM/Antifa."" David P. Bryden, a professor of law emeritus at the University of Minnesota, suggested that Trump was willing to ""vilif[y] all those of any race whom he regards as obstacles to his ambitions."" The question arose after John C. Eastman, a professor at Chapman University, wrote an op-ed in Newsweek claiming that Harris was not actually an American citizen, since neither of the parents were United States citizens at the time of her birth (a fringe interpretation of the Constitution\'s Citizenship Clause). Trump told Larry King on CNN: ""The problem with our society is the victim has absolutely no rights and the criminal has unbelievable rights"" and, speaking of another case where a woman was raped and thrown out a window, ""maybe hate is what we need if we\'re gonna get something done."" According to Mark Potok at the SPLC, Donald Trump\'s presidential campaign speeches ""demonizing statements about Latinos and Muslims have electrified the radical right, leading to glowing endorsements from white nationalist leaders such as Jared Taylor and former Klansman David Duke"". David Brooks, speaking on PBS NewsHour, called the president\'s statements ""pretty clearly racist"" and said, ""It fits into a pattern that we have seen since the beginning of his career, maybe through his father\'s career, frankly. In June 2020, Trump personally requested Interior Secretary David Bernhardt to restore a statue of Confederate General Albert Pike that had been taken down by protesters in Washington, D.C. Also in June, the US Army proposed discussions on the renaming of military bases that have been named after Confederate Army generals. Donald Trump, the president of the United States from 2017 to 2021 and current president-elect of the United States, has a history of speech and actions that have been viewed by scholars and the public as racist or sympathetic to White supremacy. Journalists, friends, family, and former employees have accused him of fueling racism in the United States. Trump has repeatedly denied accusations of racism. Conservative commentators point to the time he stated ""whether you are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots"" as an example of him not being a racist. In 1973, Trump and his company Trump Management were sued by the Department of Justice for housing discrimination against African-American renters; he settled the suit, entering into a consent decree to end the practices without admitting wrongdoing.

Hans Reiser: developer of the ReiserFS file system and convic', 'From Poseidon:\nIn a rarer - and later- version, Poseidon avoided being devoured by his father as his mother Rhea saved him in the same manner she did Zeus, by offering Cronus a foal instead, claiming she had given birth to a horse instead of a god, while she had actually laid the child in a flock. Together they had a son named Triton, a merman. The five children emerged from their father\'s belly in reverse order, making Poseidon both the second youngest child and the second oldest at the same time. Rape and assault victims\nA mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson), but loved Enipeus, a river god. By an Amazon he had a son, Hippolytus, while his wife Phaedra (Minos\' daughter) gave him two sons. This is in part an especially western feature (in Italy) because the hexastyle scheme was adopted as in the temple of Poseidon at Taranto and the second temple of Hera at Paestum (traditionally named temple of Poseidon). One day, as an Argive woman named Amymone went out in search of water, came upon a satyr who tried to rape her. Theseus, not knowing the truth, asked his father to destroy Hippolytus; Poseidon granted his son\'s wish, and as Hippolytus was driving by the sea, Poseidon sent a terrifying sea monster to spook the man\'s horses, which then dragged him to his death. Meanwhile, in Crete, Zeus\'s son Minos asked for Poseidon\'s help in order to certify his claim on the throne of Crete. Some of the oldest Greek myths appear in Boeotia. Poseidon, enraged, caused Minos\'s wife, Pasiphae, to fall in love with the bull; their coupling produced the Minotaur, a half-bull half-human creature who fed on human flesh. Because Poseidon\'s father was afraid that one of his children would overthrow him like he had done to his own father, Cronus devoured each infant as soon as they were born. The dual number is common in Indoeuropean grammar (usually for chthonic deities like the Erinyes) and the duality was used for Demeter and Persephone in classical Greece (the double named goddesses). Poseidon in fury accused Ares of murder, and the matter was eventually settled on the Areopagus (""hill of Ares"") in favour of Ares, which was thereafter named after the event. A mortal woman named Cleito once lived on an isolated island; Poseidon fell in love with the human mortal and created a dwelling sanctuary at the top of a hill near the middle of the island and surrounded the dwelling with rings of water and land to protect her. In the Odyssey, Poseidon is notable for his hatred of Odysseus who blinded the god\'s son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. He is a separate deity from the oldest Greek god of the sea Pontus. In Acrocorinth he was worshipped as Poseidon Anax during the Mycenean age. The Greeks occupied Thessaly, Boeotia and Peloponnese during the Bronze Age. Traditionally the games were established in the Bronze Age over the dead prince Palaimon. Poseidon then, equally rapacious, picked up the chase where Zeus had left it and chased Asteria with the aim to force himself on her, so Asteria had to transform for a second time to save herself, this time into a small rocky island named Delos. Poseidon is allied with Potnia and the divine child. Books\nPoseidon has appeared in modern literature, most notably in the Percy Jackson & the Olympians series, in which he plays a role as the titular character\'s father. Homer and Hesiod suggest that Poseidon became lord of the sea when, following the overthrow of his father Cronus, the world was divided by lot among Cronus\' three sons; Zeus was given the sky, Hades the underworld, and Poseidon the sea, with the Earth and Mount Olympus belonging to all three. Poseidon was the father of many heroes. Their child was a horse, Arion, which was capable of human speech. After Poseidon rescued Amymone from the lecherous satyr he fathered a child on her, Nauplius. In Plato\'s Timaeus and Critias, the legendary island of Atlantis was Poseidon\'s domain. According to Homer and Apollodorus, Zeus, Poseidon and the third brother Hades then divided the world between them by drawing lots; Zeus got the sky, Poseidon the sea, and Hades the Underworld. In Homer\'s Iliad, Poseidon supports the Greeks against the Trojans during the Trojan War; in the Odyssey, during the sea-voyage from Troy back home to Ithaca, the Greek hero Odysseus provokes Poseidon\'s fury by blinding his son, the Cyclops Polyphemus, resulting in Poseidon punishing him with storms, causing the complete loss of his ship and companions, and delaying his return by ten years. In this version, Poseidon is portrayed as the father of the Sea Witch Ursula. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and in time succeeded his father Aegeus as king of Athens. Demeter\'s mare-form was worshipped into historical times. Not all of Poseidon\'s children were human. Burkert noted :""In cult, Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus"" and ""the myth turns this into a temporal-causal sequence: in his anger at losing, Poseidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and kille', 'From List of serial killers by country:\nCurrently the longest-incarcerated inmate in South America.

The fifth column states the number of possible victims the killer could have murdered. There are gaps of time between the killings, which may range from a few days to months, or many years. This is not a reflection of an individual\'s overall rank, which may or may not vary depending on personal opinion concerning the nature and circumstances of their crimes. This list does not include mass murderers, spree killers, war criminals, members of democidal governments, or major political figures, such as Adolf Hitler, Francisco Franco, Hideki Tojo, Suharto, Mao Zedong, Joseph Stalin, or Pol Pot.', 'From Serial killer:\nSuch killers are sometimes abused as children, leaving them with feelings of powerlessness and inadequacy as adults. This need for approval is what influences children to attempt to develop social relationships with their family and peers. One ""analysis of 86 female serial killers from the United States found that the victims tended to be spouses, children or the elderly"". They were frequently bullied or socially isolated as children. In general, the IQs of organized serial killers tend to be normal range, with a mean of 98.7. Between 1564 and 1589, German farmer Peter Stumpp killed 14 children, including his own son. Mixed serial killers, with both organized and disorganized traits, have an average IQ of 100.9, but a low sample size. Chromosomal makeup\nThere have been studies looking into the possibility that an abnormality with one\'s chromosomes could be the trigger for serial killers. Often, organized killers have social and other interpersonal skills sufficient to enable them to develop both personal and romantic relationships, friends and lovers and sometimes even attract and maintain a spouse and sustain a family including children. Recently, marketing has capitalized even more upon interest in serial killers with the rise of various merchandise such as trading cards, action figures, and books. With serial murders, the focus is typically on unsolved cases, with evidence thought to be related to the case at hand. Visionary\nVisionary serial killers suffer from psychotic breaks with reality, sometimes believing they are another person or are compelled to murder by entities such as the Devil or God. Fantasy\nChildren who do not have the power to control the mistreatment they suffer sometimes create a new reality to which they can escape. Disorganized serial killers are usually far more impulsive, often committing their murders with a random weapon available at the time, and usually do not attempt to hide the body. As lust killers continue with their murders, the time between killings decreases or the required level of stimulation increases, sometimes both. They are involved in sadistic activity; especially in children who have not reached sexual maturity, this activity may take the form of torturing animals. Psychopathic behavior that is consistent with traits common to some serial killers include sensation seeking, a lack of remorse or guilt, impulsivity, the need for control, and predatory behavior. It is believed she killed 11 to 46 infants and children while working at Bexar County Medical Center Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, United States. Andrew Cunanan is given as an example of spree killing, while Charles Whitman is mentioned in connection with mass murder, and Jeffrey Dahmer with serial killing. The number of active serial killers in the United States peaked in 1989 and has been steadily trending downward since, coinciding with an overall decrease in crime in the United States since that time. ""The quality of their attachments to parents and other members of the family is critical to how these children relate to and value other members of society."" Sources suggest that female serial killers represented less than one in every six known serial murderers in the United States between 1800 and 2004 (64 females from a total of 416 known offenders), or that around 15% of U.S. serial killers have been women, with a collective number of victims between 427 and 612. However, at the same time of the Holmes case, in France, Joseph Vacher became known as ""The French Ripper"" after killing and mutilating 11 women and children. Many power- or control-motivated killers sexually abuse their victims, but they differ from hedonistic killers in that rape is not motivated by lust (as it would be with a lust murder) but as simply another form of dominating the victim. He was considered a pillar of the local community; he even won a professional award for a children\'s asthma clinic and was interviewed by Granada Television\'s World in Action on ITV. Although motivations for female serial killers can include attention seeking, addiction, or the result of psychopathological behavioral factors, female serial killers are commonly categorized as murdering men for material gain, usually being emotionally close to their victims, and generally needing to have a relationship with the victim, hence the traditional cultural image of the ""black widow"". Female serial killers are often comfort killers, although not all comfort killers are female. In other cases, women have been involved as an accomplice with a male serial killer as a part of a serial killing team. A similar case occurred in Britain in 1991, where nurse Beverley Allitt killed four children at the hospital where she worked, attempted to kill three more, and injured a further six over the course of two months. Disorganized serial killers have been found to have a lower mean IQ than organized serial killers, at 89.4.

Both playful and complex stages are said to arrive following the game's release in the form of post-launch downloadable content by the end of 2024. The game provides a selection of accessibility settings, which include granting the player the option to play the game with a single analog stick (with camera controls instead coming from a single button press), support for the PlayStation Access controller, and the option to disable the gyro controls, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers. The online levels were released every week from October 17, 2024, to November 14, 2024, and featured additional V.I.P. Five of the game's levels are based heavily on classic PlayStation franchises, which in turn, each represent previous PlayStation consoles – namely Ape Escape (PlayStation), God of War (PlayStation 2), Uncharted (PlayStation 3), LocoRoco (PlayStation Portable), and Horizon (PlayStation 4). The reason for this, as stated by Doucet, was because using the touchpad requires the player to move their fingers away from the jump button, thus causing the game to become more uncomfortable to play. Three versions of the game are available for purchase, those being the digital standard edition, physical standard edition, and digital deluxe editions. The game was positively compared to games in the Super Mario series, particularly Super Mario Sunshine, Super Mario Galaxy, and Super Mario Odyssey. Critics also compared the game to other Nintendo series, including Arms, Pikmin, and Splatoon. The main levels were designed to be relatively easy, allowing anyone to beat the game regardless of their skill level.

This precedent was followed for the 1918 prize awarded to Max Planck in 1919,\nthe 1921 prize awarded to Albert Einstein in 1922,\nthe 1924 prize awarded to Manne Siegbahn in 1925,\nthe 1925 prize awarded to James Franck and Gustav Hertz in 1926,\nthe 1928 prize awarded to Owen Richardson in 1929,\nthe 1932 prize awarded to Werner Heisenberg in 1933, and\nthe 1943 prize awarded to Otto Stern in 1944. Only five women have won the prize: Marie Curie (1903), Maria Goeppert-Mayer (1963), Donna Strickland (2018), Andrea Ghez (2020), and Anne L'Huillier (2023).

When the group went bankrupt in 2004, the factory was a subsidiary of SEB, and general company for electric motors was revived as Euromoteurs, with SEB as the only customer. President Vincent Auriol laid the first stone just four years after landing. The Saint-Lô site had 150 employees and manufactured small and medium power electric motors. It was at that time the largest hospital in Europe. Paul-Jacques Bonzon, youth novelist\nAlbert II, current Prince of Monaco, who carries Baron of Saint-Lô amongst his many titles. The school gains about 40 new students each year. One can still find the tomb of the French revolutionary general Dagobert. There are between 30 and 40 days of frost per year. Moulinex: The Moulinex factory has long been the largest plant in Saint-Lô. Saint-Lô was then the third largest town in the Duchy of Normandy after Rouen and Caen. National Stud\nSaint-Lô is home to the largest of the 23 national stud farms in France. Although it is the second largest city of Manche after Cherbourg, it remains the prefecture of the department. It has an average annual rainfall of 800 to 900 mm (31 to 35 in) per year. General de Gaulle offered to the Sultan of Morocco Bois de Rose, a thoroughbred which had been stationed at the stud for two years. Rainfall is quite frequent throughout the year but most abundant in autumn and winter, in connection with the disturbances coming from the Atlantic Ocean. The village of Le Hutrel: In the middle of the Saint-Lô bocage, Le Hutrel has a village festival, in its square, every year on Ascension Thursday. The city also has the Livestock Promotion Centre, located next to the stud farm, which hosts the equestrian competition of the Normandy horse show, each year in August. This would be done on the basis of plans designed by the Chief Architect of the reconstruction André Hilt (died 1946), which had proposed to retain the general fabric of the town by adapting it to modern needs. By order of Major General Charles Gerhardt, a jeep carried the body of Major Thomas Howie, later immortalized as ""The Major of St. Lô"", wrapped in a flag on its hood so that it could be said that he was the first American to enter the city. Saint-Lô (US: , French: [sɛ̃ lo] ; Breton: Sant Lo) is a commune in northwest France, the capital of the Manche department in the region of Normandy. It is also chef-lieu of an arrondissement and two cantons (Saint-Lô-1 and Saint-Lô-2). The placename derives from that of a local saint, Laud of Coutances. The commune has 18,931 inhabitants who are called Saint-Lois(es). The names of Laudois(es), Laudien(ne)s or Laudinien(ne)s are also cited. A martyr city of World War II, Saint-Lô was decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1948 and was given the nickname ""Capital of the Ruins"", a phrase popularised by Samuel Beckett. Geography\nLocation\nSaint-Lô is in the centre of Manche, in the middle of the Saint-Lois bocage, 57 km (35 mi) west of Caen, 78 km (48 mi) south of Cherbourg and 119 km (74 mi) north of Rennes. The city was born under the name of Briovera on a rocky outcrop of schist belonging to the Armorican Massif, in the Cotentin Peninsula, between the confluences of the Vire – which dominates the city centre – with the Dollée and Torteron, two rivers channelled in their urban sections. This historic heart of the city became L\'Enclos, a site well suited to passive defence. The east of the territory is the former commune of Sainte-Croix-de-Saint-Lô, south of Saint-Thomas-de-Saint-Lô, absorbed in 1964. Climate\nSaint-Lô has a mild oceanic climate characterised by mild winters and temperate summers. Rarely intense, they often fall in the form of drizzle. The average temperature is 10 °C (50 °F). In winter, the average temperature ranges between 1 and 7 °C (34 and 45 °F). In summer, the average temperature lies around 20 °C (68 °F). Transport\nSaint-Lô is located in the centre of the department of Manche and is therefore a node of communication between Nord-Cotentin and southern Manche. Road\nSaint-Lô lies halfway along the Coutances–Bayeux axis (RD 972). A bypass road was commissioned in the 1980s to allow the decongestion of the city from the south. To open up the port of Cherbourg, the region and the department decided the construction of a dual carriageway, RN 174. It is a part of the European route E03 and enables direct connection to Rennes and Europe from the south, through the interchange at Guilberville. The southern section now connects Saint-Lô directly to the A84 autoroute, allowing motorway access to Caen and Rennes. The commissioning of the northern section, which is currently under construction, will meanwhile allow access to Cherbourg and England vi', 'From Ban Ki-moon:\nMoon was eventually elected president on 10 May. Ban was named in a lawsuit challenging UN legal immunity on behalf of Haitians with cholera in the U.S. District Court of Manhattan. However, recent polls showed Moon Jae-in of the main opposition Minjoo Party of Korea in the lead with a support rating of 32.8 percent, while Ban trailed in distant second with 15.4 percent. The first phase of the peacekeeping mission began in October 2007. In 1974 he received his first posting to the United Nations, as First Secretary of the South Permanent Observer Mission (South Korea became a full UN member-state on 17 September 1991). Ban Ki-moon\'s first mandate as the Secretary-General was set to end on 31 December 2011. Though Ban was the first to announce a candidacy, he was not originally considered a serious contender. During Ban\'s first year as secretary-general, more top jobs were being handled by women than ever before. For example, Ban became the first senior South Korean minister to travel to the Republic of the Congo since its independence in 1960. The Libyan Civil War began in 2011, the last year of Ban\'s first term, and dominated his attention and public statements that year. Ban initially said that he would delay making other appointments until his first round of reforms were approved, yet later abandoned this idea after receiving criticism. Ban\'s first overseas posting was to New Delhi, India, where he served as vice consul and impressed many of his superiors in the foreign ministry with his competence. Reform agenda\nDuring his first month in office, Ban proposed two major reforms: to split the UN peacekeeping operation into two departments and to combine the political affairs and disarmament department. Humanitarian action\nOn 25 January 2012, Ban announced that he would convene the world\'s first summit on humanitarian aid in order to ""share knowledge and establish common best practices."" Darfur\nBan took the first foreign trip of his term to attend the African Union summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in January 2007 as part of an effort to reach out to the Group of 77. Nonetheless, according to ""some officials"" in the Post story, Ban had allegedly gone further, boosting South Korea\'s presence in UN ranks by more than 20 percent during his first year in office. United Nations career\nCampaign for secretary-general: 2007\nIn February 2006, Ban declared his candidacy to replace Kofi Annan as UN Secretary-General at the end of 2006, becoming the first South Korean to run for the office. Before starting, Kofi Annan shared the story that when the first Secretary-General Trygve Lie left office, he told his successor, Dag Hammarskjöld, ""You are about to take over the most impossible job on earth"". He became the first major international diplomat to throw his weight behind the Green New Deal, a nascent effort by the progressive wing of the Democratic Party in the United States to zero out planet-warming emissions and end poverty over the next decade. At his first encounter with the press as Secretary-General on 2 January 2007, he refused to condemn the death penalty imposed on Saddam Hussein by the Iraqi High Tribunal, remarking, ""The issue of capital punishment is for each and every member State to decide"".

Middle East\nOn Thursday, 22 March 2007, while Ban was taking part in the first stop of a tour of the Middle East, a mortar attack hit just 80 meters (260 ft) from where the Secretary-General was standing, interrupting a press conference in Baghdad\'s Green Zone, and visibly shaking Ban and others. First term as secretary-general\nWhen Ban became secretary-general, The Economist listed the major challenges facing him in 2007: ""rising nuclear demons in Iran and North Korea, a haemorrhaging wound in Darfur, unending violence in the Middle East, looming environmental disaster, escalating international terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the spread of HIV/AIDS. Ban Ki-moon (Korean: 반기문 [pan.ɡi.mun]; born 13 June 1944) is a South Korean politician and diplomat who served as the eighth secretary-general of the United Nations between 2007 and 2016. Prior to his appointment as secretary-general, Ban was the South Korean minister of foreign affairs and trade between 2004 and 2006.

History\n1911 beginnings and controversy\nIn 1909 the Automobile Club de Monaco (Sport Automobile Vélocipédique Monégasque) started planning a car rally at the behest of Albert I, Prince of Monaco. The Monte Carlo Rally was to start at points all over Europe and converge on Monte Carlo. See also\nMonte Carlo or Bust! Herbie Goes to Monte Carlo\n\nNotes\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website As recently as 1991, competitors were able to choose their starting points from approximately five venues roughly equidistant from Monte Carlo (one of Monaco\'s administrative areas) itself. As recently as 1991, competitors were able to choose their starting points from approximately five venues roughly equidistant from Monte Carlo (one of Monaco\'s administrative areas) itself. The headline in Motor Sport read ""The Monte Carlo Fiasco"". The Automobile Club de Monaco confirmed on 19 July 2010 that the 79th Monte-Carlo Rally would form the opening round of the new Intercontinental Rally Challenge season. To mark the centenary event, the Automobile Club de Monaco has also confirmed that Glasgow, Barcelona, Warsaw and Marrakesh have been selected as start points for the rally. Multiple winners\nYear in italic was not WRC event\n\nRelated events\nThe Monte Carlo Historic Rally (officially Rallye Monte-Carlo Historique) is a classic regularity rally held annually since 1998. The Monte Carlo E-Rally (officially E-Rallye Monte-Carlo) is a regularity rally for alternative fuel vehicles, held annually under different names from 1995 to 1999 and later since 2005. The first four finishers, driving three Mini-Coopers, Timo Mäkinen, Rauno Aaltonen and Paddy Hopkirk, and Roger Clark\'s 4th-placed Ford Cortina were all disqualified because they used non-dipping single filament quartz iodine bulbs in their headlamps, in place of the standard double filament dipping glass bulbs, which are fitted to the series production version of each models sold to the public. The rally now takes place along the French Riviera in Monaco and southeast France. From its inception in 1911 by Prince Albert I, the rally was intended to demonstrate improvements and innovations in automobiles, and promote Monaco as a tourist resort on the Mediterranean shore. Before the format changed in 1997, the event was a “concentration rally” in which competitors would set off from various starting points around Europe and drive to Monaco, where the rally would continue to a set of special stages. In January 1911 23 cars set out from 11 different locations and Henri Rougier was among the nine who left Paris to cover a 1,020 kilometres (634 mi) route. The event was won by Rougier in a Turcat-Méry 25 Hp. The rally comprised both driving and then somewhat arbitrary judging based on the elegance of the car, passenger comfort and the condition in which it arrived in the principality. The outcry of scandal when the results were published changed nothing, so Rougier was proclaimed the first winner. Following the Second World War, works or works-supported teams became more and more important. From 1949 onwards, there was a special Team prize. First winners were the three Allards of Potter, Godsall and Imhof. Simca, Delahaye, Sunbeam-Talbot, Jaguar were subsequent winners. Sydney Allard – as the first and only winner driving his own car – was driving a ""works"" car in 1952, but Gatsonides also participated in a factory prepared Ford Zephyr in 1953, a year that saw no fewer than eight factory backed Sunbeam-Talbots. 1966 controversy\nThe 1966 event was the most controversial in the history of the Rally. This elevated Pauli Toivonen (Citroën ID) into first place overall. Rosemary Smith (Hillman Imp) was also disqualified from sixth place, after winning the Coupe des Dames, the ladies\' class. In all, ten cars were disqualified. Teams threatened to boycott the event. Recent history\nFrom 1973 to 2008 the rally was held in January as the first event of the FIA World Rally Championship, but between 2009 and 2011 it was the opening round of the Intercontinental Rally Challenge (IRC) programme, a championship for N/A 4WD cars, before returning to the WRC championship season again in 2012. With often varying conditions at each starting point (typically comprising dry tarmac, wet tarmac, snow, and ice, sometimes all in a single stage of the rally), this event places a big emphasis on tyre choices, as a driver has to balance the need for grip on ice and snow with the need for grip on dry tarmac. For the driver, this is often a difficult choice as the tyres that work well on snow and ice normally perform poorly on dry tarmac.

Recent notable honors with current members of the Los Angeles Rams include NFL Coach of the Year in 2017 for Sean McVay, Super Bowl MVP for Cooper Kupp in 2021, and NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2017, 2018, and 2020 for Aaron Donald. Following the Rams\' victory in Super Bowl LVI, the organization awarded Strauss a Super Bowl ring. The two teams became the first in league history to win a Super Bowl in their home stadiums as Tampa won Super Bowl LV in 2021, and Los Angeles won Super Bowl LVI a year later. The following week, the Rams beat the Saints on the road 26–23 to advance to the Super Bowl for the first time since Super Bowl XXXVI in January 2002, and since Super Bowl XIV in January 1980 as a Los Angeles team. The Rams made their first Super Bowl appearance at the end of the 1979 NFL season, losing Super Bowl XIV to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 31–19. Three years later, the Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23–20 to win Super Bowl LVI, becoming the second NFL team to win the Super Bowl in its home stadium. The teams have two Super Bowl wins and seven division titles since 2010. Warner was named the Most Valuable Player of the Super Bowl. The Rams lost in Super Bowl LIII held at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia, to the New England Patriots by a score of 13–3 in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history. The Rams later advanced to win Super Bowl LVI as a result. The Rams appeared in Super Bowl LIII but lost to the Patriots, 13–3. (Also, as a group of sheep are formally called a ""mob"".) The club then lost Super Bowl XXXVI, 20–17, to the New England Patriots. The Rams\' opponent in their first Super Bowl was the defending champion Pittsburgh Steelers. The Rams chose the white alternates with yellow pants as their Super Bowl LVI uniform. Super Bowl LVI champions (2021)\nBefore Super Bowl LV was played, the Rams agreed to a blockbuster trade, dealing the inconsistent Jared Goff to the Detroit Lions in exchange for Detroit\'s own quarterback, Matthew Stafford. This also marked the second year in a row that a team that played in the Super Bowl played in their home stadium (SoFi Stadium), as in Super Bowl LV, the Buccaneers won against the Chiefs in Raymond James Stadium. Five seasons later, the team defeated the Tennessee Titans to win Super Bowl XXXIV, 23–16. This led the Rams to Super Bowl XXXIV, where they beat the Tennessee Titans, 23–16. After becoming Super Bowl champions, there was some doubt as to whether Aaron Donald and Sean McVay would return to the team, as reports began to circulate shortly before the Super Bowl that Donald was considering retirement, and McVay had been offered a TV deal with ESPN. Super Bowl hangover and retooling (2022–23)\nThe Rams\' 2022 season began on a low note; despite opening the season celebrating their Super Bowl victory at home, they were unable to capitalize on two first half turnovers by Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, falling 31–10. Rumors in the offseason swirled around Gurley and his knee injury, as despite a strong performance in the divisional round against the Cowboys, Gurley\'s performances in the NFC Championship and Super Bowl LIII were lackluster, and it was later reported after the Super Bowl that Gurley had arthritis in his knee. It was the first time in 35 years that a Los Angeles team was featured in a Super Bowl. In one of the greatest upsets in Super Bowl history, the New York Giants defeated the Patriots, 17–14. His toughness was legendary, notably playing on a broken leg during the Rams\' run to the 1980 Super Bowl. Two of those matchups decided the NFC\'s representative in the Super Bowl, with the Cowboys prevailing on both occasions. Both teams combine for four Super Bowl championships as they regularly fought for control of the conference in the early 2000s and 2020s respectively. Kansas City Chiefs\nWhilst the Rams were in St. Louis, the team had an intrastate rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each matchup. He managed to take the Rams to Super Bowl XXXVI, where the team lost to the New England Patriots, 20–17. The Los Angeles Rams appeared in the postseason in four of the five last seasons, including a Super Bowl championship in the 2021 NFL season and an appearance in the Super Bowl–the first since 2001–after the 2018 NFL season. He was voted the MVP of the NFL in 1969, for a season in which he threw for 2,549 yards and 24 TDs while leading the Rams to the playoffs. On Cincinnati\'s final drive, the Bengals faced a 4th & 1 near mid-field, and, in a moment mirroring his game-winning tackle of Jimmy Garoppolo two weeks ago, Aaron Donald tackled Joe Burrow, and his final desperation throw fell incomplete, giving the Rams their second Super Bowl win as well as their fir', 'From St. Louis Rams:\nWarner was named Super Bowl MVP. On January 5, 2015, the Los Angeles Times reported that Stan Kroenke and Stockbridge Capital Group were partnering up to develop a new NFL stadium on the Inglewood property owned by Kroenke. Kroenke subsequently announced plans to build an NFL stadium on the site, in connection with the owners of the adjacent 238-acre (96 ha) Hollywood Park site, Stockbridge Capital Group. Following the Rams’ Super Bowl victory, Vermeil retired from football (though he came back in 2001 as head coach of the Kansas City Chiefs) and was replaced by offensive coordinator (and apprentice) Mike Martz. Vermeil had enjoyed success as the head coach of UCLA, where he won a Rose Bowl, and the Philadelphia Eagles, who he led to Super Bowl XV. The other remaining former St. Louis Rams players still active are Greg Zuerlein, Rodney McLeod, Johnny Hekker, and Case Keenum. Spagnuolo had masterminded the Giants’ defensive scheme that shut down the previously undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII. Following their 2002 Super Bowl defeat to the New England Patriots, the Rams struggled for their remaining years in St. Louis. Super Bowl XXXVI later became part of the wider 2007 National Football League videotaping controversy, also known as “Spygate"". The franchise notched its first winning season and playoff appearance as a St. Louis, Missouri team in 1999, and went on to win its first and only championship in Super Bowl XXXIV. The move to Anaheim\nBefore the Rams’ 1979 Super Bowl season, the team\'s owner Carroll Rosenbloom drowned in an accident. 1999–2001: The Greatest Show on Turf\n1999: Super Bowl champions\nFinally, in 1999, there appeared to be reason for hope. Making matters even worse, the Rams were unsuccessful on the field, while the Raiders were thriving, winning Super Bowl XVIII in 1983. After further investigation, the league determined that no tape of the Rams’ Super Bowl walkthrough was made, and the Herald later issued an apology in 2008 for the article. The Rams then hired head coach Jeff Fisher, who had led the Tennessee Titans in their Super Bowl XXXIV loss to the Rams 12 years earlier. I beg to differ.”\nThe Rams’ opponent in Super Bowl XXXIV was the Tennessee Titans, who, like the Rams, had recently relocated cities. Warner captured the NFL MVP award at season\'s end, while the 1999 NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award went to Faulk. That season began a three-year run of success with The Greatest Show on Turf offense, which included a franchise-best 14–2 record in 2001 en route to a Super Bowl XXXVI appearance. In a game that many consider the best Super Bowl ever, Tennessee played the Rams tough throughout, achieving a 16–16 tie with 2:12 left on an Al Del Greco field goal. After handling the Green Bay Packers in the divisional playoffs, the Rams fought off the Philadelphia Eagles in the NFC Championship Game 29–24 to reach their second Super Bowl in three seasons. Their opponents in Super Bowl XXXVI would be the New England Patriots who, much as the Rams had had two years previous, had enjoyed a Cinderella playoff run, highlighted by a dramatic and controversial 16–13 divisional playoff win against the Oakland Raiders. greater Orange County) and a decline in the city of Los Angeles\'s population and income. Then, despite being heavily favored along with Charlotte to win an expansion team, St. Louis lost to a group from Jacksonville, Florida. Dyson caught the pass at the 3-yard line but was stopped in a play known as “The Tackle”; Rams linebacker Mike Jones brought Dyson down just 18 inches, or half a yard, shy of the goal line, ending the game and giving the Rams and coach Dick Vermeil their first Super Bowl victory. 2001: Third Super Bowl and loss to the Patriots\nIn 2001, the “Max Q” Rams went 14–2 (including a spectacular 8–0 on the road), led not only by a sensational offense (their third straight year of scoring 500 or more points), but a good defense as well, coached by Lovie Smith and led by Adam Archuleta. While the Edward Jones Dome was not at sell out capacity, a sizeable group of Rams fans attended the game, holding signs that read “Keep the Rams in St. Louis.” Enthusiastic chants of “Keep the Rams” and “Kroenke Sucks” were heard during and after the game. They went on to win three Super Bowls in a four-year span, and have played in nine since the 2001 season as of 2020. Gurley was one of three rookies to be selected to the Pro Bowl, along with Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters and Seahawks wide receiver and kick returner Tyler Lockett. On February 24, 2015, the Inglewood City Council approved the stadium plan and the initiative, and construction began on the new stadium on December 21, 2015, on the former Hollywood Park site. The City of St. Louis, in subsequent years, did make changes to the scoreboard and increased the natural lighting by replacing panels with windows, although the overall feel remained dark.

On 2 December 1994, the City of Sale was abolished, and along with the Shires of Alberton, Avon and Maffra, and parts of the Shire of Rosedale, was merged into the newly created Shire of Wellington.

The city covered an area of 29.78 square kilometres (11.5 sq mi), and existed from 1863 until 1994. It became a town on 17 September 1924, and was proclaimed a city on 31 May 1950. In 1966-1967, it annexed a small area to its east and north-east from the Shire of Avon. History\nSale was first incorporated as a borough on 10 August 1863, and was extended on 24 December 1873.

The capital city is considered one of the projects for economic development, and is part of a larger initiative called Egypt Vision 2030. According to the plans, the city will become the new administrative and financial capital of Egypt, housing the main government departments and ministries and foreign embassies. In January 2021, Egypt signed a contract with Siemens to construct a high speed rail line that extends from the northern Mediterranean city of El Alamein to Ain Sokhna city on the Red Sea passing through the new capital and Alexandria. The new city is to be located 45 kilometres (28 miles) east of Cairo and just outside the Second Greater Cairo Ring Road, in a largely undeveloped area halfway to the seaport city of Suez. The proposed builder of the city was Capital City Partners, a private real estate investment firm led by Emirati businessman Mohamed Alabbar. Feedback on former experiences of capital relocation was looked at, for instance by meeting with representatives from Astana, which replaced Almaty as the capital city of Kazakhstan in 1997. The New Administrative Capital (NAC) (Arabic: العاصمة الإدارية الجديدة, romanized: al-ʿĀṣima al-ʾIdārīya al-Jadīda), is a new urban community in Cairo Governorate, Egypt and a satellite of Cairo City. This left the Egyptian government to finance and manage most of the construction, setting up the Administrative Capital Urban Development Company (ACUD) on 21 April 2016, an Egyptian state owned enterprise (SOE) whose major shareholders are the Ministry of Defence (National Service Products Organisation and the Armed Forces Land Projects Authority) holding 51% by in-kind contribution of the land, and the Ministry of Housing\'s New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA), holding 49% of the shares via capital injection of EGP 20bn (US$2.2bn in 2016) and an authorised capital of EGP 204bn (US$22bn). As of 5 May 2023, 14 ministries and government entities have relocated to the New Administrative Capital. A competition was launched on the new capital\'s website to choose a new name and logo for the city. Moving state institutions\nIt was originally planned that parliament, presidential palaces, government ministries and foreign embassies would be moved into the city between 2020 and 2022, but due to construction delays and COVID-19 the move of over 30,000 government employees was delayed to March 2023. Some amenities planned for the city are a central park, artificial lakes, around 2,000 educational institutions, technology and innovation park, 18 hospitals, 1,250 mosques and churches, a 93,440-seat stadium, 40,000 hotel rooms, a major theme park four times the size of Disneyland, 90 square kilometres of solar energy farms and electric railway link with Cairo. One runs northward, parallel to the Cairo Ring Road, to 10th of Ramadan City, while the other turns south towards the New Administrative Capital. Plans\nThe city is planned to consist of a government administrative district, a diplomatic quarter, a cultural district (opera and theatres), a central business district (CBD), parks (the \'green river\'), and 21 residential districts. The Misr Stadium (also known as Sports City Stadium) opened in 2024 with a capacity of over 93,900 people; it is the largest stadium in Egypt and the second largest in Africa. The line starts at Adly Mansour Station at Al Salam City on Cairo Metro Line 3, and splits into two branches at Badr City. The initial phase of the park will be of about the first 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) and is under construction. In the same month Egypt signed a new MoU with China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) to ""study building and financing"" the administrative part of the new capital, which will include ministries, government agencies and the president\'s office. The complex is considered the largest of its kind in the Middle East and one of the largest in the world, much like The Pentagon in the United States of America. It is considered the largest of its kind in Egypt and the Middle East. It is the largest of mosque in Egypt and third largest in the Middle East. Finance and construction\nWhen the project was officially announced in March 2015, it was revealed that the Egyptian military had already begun building a road from Cairo to the site of the future capital. The airport has an area of 16 square kilometres (6.2 sq mi) and is expected to partially ease the pressure on Cairo International Airport and Sphinx International Airport. It is being built as a smart city with over 6,000 cameras monitoring the streets and along with this authorities will be using AI to monitor water use and waste management, and residents will be able to submit complaints into a mobile app. Criticism\nSocial inequality\nMany have criticized t', 'From New England Patriots:\nAfter advancing to Super Bowl XLII, the team\'s fourth Super Bowl in seven years, the Patriots were upset by the Giants to end their bid for a 19–0 season. They are specifically from the Associated Press, except for two cases: The NFL in the case of the Super Bowl MVP and the Pro Football Writers of America in the case of the Executive of the Year award. During Sullivan\'s 28 seasons of owning the club, the Patriots tallied 14 winning records, made six playoff appearances, played in the 1963 AFL Championship Game and represented the AFC in Super Bowl XX. In 2000, the Patriots hired head coach Bill Belichick, who had served as defensive coordinator under Parcells including during Super Bowl XXXI. However, both the Bears and 49ers lost their only game during the regular season, and both would win their respective Super Bowl. The Patriots extended their record to ten Super Bowl appearances in the 2017–18 playoffs but lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII. Pro Bowl selections\nThe following Patriots players have been named to the Pro Bowl (or the AFL All-Star game prior to 1970):\nTwo Patriots has been named Pro Bowl MVP, Vito ""Babe"" Parilli in 1966 (AFL), and Ty Law as co-MVP in 1998. In the first overtime in Super Bowl history, the Patriots won the coin toss and scored a touchdown to claim their fifth Super Bowl victory. The Patriots returned to the championship game for a third consecutive season in Super Bowl LIII, where they defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to win their sixth Super Bowl, tying them with the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl victories in NFL history. The Patriots reached a record-tying eighth Super Bowl, where they defeated the defending champion Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24 to win Super Bowl XLIX for their fourth title. The teams met three times in four years (2003, 2004, 2006) in the playoffs, with the winner going on to win that season\'s Super Bowl each time. New England became the first team to reach nine Super Bowls in the 2016–17 playoffs and faced the Atlanta Falcons in Super Bowl LI. The Giants also defeated the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, a 21–17 victory. The Patriots returned to the Super Bowl in 2011 but lost again to the Giants, 21–17.

Continuing on as head coach under Kraft\'s ownership, Parcells would bring the Patriots to two playoff appearances, including Super Bowl XXXI (following the 1996 season), which they lost to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35–21. Brady eventually agreed to serve the suspension in 2016, but led the Patriots to win Super Bowl LI in spite of it. The Brady–Belichick era, regarded as one of the greatest sports dynasties, would see the Patriots claim nearly every major Super Bowl record. Later that season, the Steelers lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Patriots in the AFC Championship game after a 15–1 regular season. Throughout the 2011 season, the Patriots wore dark patches with white lettering on their uniforms with the initials \'MHK\' in honor of Myra Kraft, the late long-time spouse of owner Robert Kraft. Holovak, Raymond Berry and Parcells all led the Patriots to league championship games, with only one coach failing to reach the Super Bowl. While Belichick led the team to nine of their eleven Super Bowl appearances, winning six of them, before him the Patriots saw some championship game appearances. Boston University Field, Harvard Stadium, Fenway Park (shared with baseball\'s Boston Red Sox), and Boston College\'s Alumni Stadium all served as home fields during their time in the American Football League. Parcells, a two winning Super Bowl champion coach with the New York Giants (also was an assistant with the Patriots in the early 1980s), had joined New England\'s staff for the 1993 season to help resurrect the franchise from its dark early 1990s days but had conflicted interests with owner Robert Kraft. He specifically led the Patriots to 17 AFC East division titles, 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and nine Super Bowl appearances, with a record six wins. The New England Patriots are noted for the following characteristics under coach Belichick\'s tenure, dubbed as the ""Patriot Way"":\n\nTheir self-critical, perfectionist, and militaristic approach\nTheir emphasis on team, equality among players and lack of individual ego\nTheir strong work ethic, intelligence and high level of focus and preparation for each individual game\nTheir versatile players, able to play multiple positions\nTheir multiple schemes intended to take advantage of their opponent\'s weaknesses\n\nChampionships\nSuper Bowl championships\nThe New England Patriots have won six Super Bowls, the league championship of the NFL.

From the 1990s, a number of historians replaced the historical title ""English Civil War"" with ""Wars of the Three Kingdoms"" and ""British Civil Wars"", positing that the civil war in England cannot be understood apart from events in other parts of Britain and Ireland. Terminology\nThe term English Civil War appears most often in the singular, but historians often divide the conflict into two or three separate wars. Historical interpretations\nHobbes\' Behemoth\nThomas Hobbes gave an early historical account of the English Civil War in his Behemoth, written in 1668 and published in 1681. Episcopacy\nDuring the English Civil War, the role of bishops as wielders of political power and upholders of the established church became a matter of heated political controversy. (2013), England\'s wars of religion, revisited, Ashgate – 14 scholars discuss the argument of John Morrill that the English Civil War was the last war of religion, rather than the first modern revolution. The Whig view was challenged and largely superseded by the Marxist school, which became popular in the 1940s, and saw the English Civil War as a bourgeois revolution. The controversy eventually led to Laud\'s impeachment for treason by a bill of attainder in 1645 and subsequent execution. The war was of unprecedented scale for the English. Later views\nIn the 1970s, revisionist historians challenged both the Whig and the Marxist theories, notably in the 1973 anthology The Origins of the English Civil War (Conrad Russell ed.). A number of revisionist historians such as William M. Lamont regarded the conflict as a religious war, with John Morrill (1993) stating: \'The English Civil War was not the first European revolution: it was the last of the Wars of Religion.\' (103 KiB) by Brandon W Duke\nThis page has links to some transcriptions of contemporary documents concerning eas', 'From Execution of Charles I:\nThe execution was the culmination of political and military conflicts between the royalists and the parliamentarians in England during the English Civil War, leading to the capture and trial of Charles. The book gained massive popularity in a short time, going into twenty editions by the first month of its publication, and has been named by Philip A. Knachel ""the most widely read, widely discussed work of royalist propaganda to issue from the English Civil War"". Much Restoration historiography of the Civil War emphasised the regicide as a grand and theatrical tragedy, depicting the last days of Charles\'s life in a hagiographical fashion. This Whig view was exemplified by the Victorian historian Samuel Rawson Gardiner as he closed his late 19th-century History of the Great Civil War:\n\nWhether the necessity really existed or was but the tyrant\'s plea is a question upon the answer to which men have long differed, and will probably continue to differ. The execution has been described as one of the most significant and controversial events in English history. On the other side, the parliamentarians led their own propaganda war against these royalists reports. Legacy\nThe image of Charles\'s execution was central to the cult of St. Charles the Martyr, a major theme in English royalism of this period. Despite this, very little action was taken against the new English government, as foreign governments carefully avoided cutting off relations with England over their condemnations of the execution. Joyce was a loyal fanatic of Cromwell and had, earlier in the war, captured the king from Holdenby House. For D\'Israeli, ""the martyrdom of Charles was a civil and political one"", which ""seems an expiation of the errors and infirmities of the early years of his reign."" When Cromwell led the English forces to victory over Charles II and his Scottish supporters at Dunbar in September 1650, the churches of New England celebrated with a day of thanksgiving. He also banned all English merchants from his country (notably members of the Muscovy Company) and provided financial assistance to Charles II, sending his condolences to Henrietta Maria, ""the disconsolate widow of that glorious martyr, King Charles I"". After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, this private devotion was transformed into official worship; in 1661, the Church of England declared 30 January a solemn fast for the martyrdom of Charles and Charles occupied a saint-like status in contemporary prayer books. Some view it as the martyrdom of an innocent man, with Restoration historian Edward Hyde describing ""a year of reproach and infamy above all years which had passed before it; a year of the highest dissimulation and hypocrisy, of the deepest villainy and most bloody treasons that any nation was ever cursed with"" and the Tory Isaac D\'Israeli writing of Charles as ""having received the axe with the same collectedness of thought and died with the majesty with which he had lived"", dying a ""civil and political"" martyr to Britain. Execution\nThe execution was set to be carried out on 30 January 1649. Shortly after the execution, Hulet received a prominent and swift promotion and he was not seen to be present on the day of Charles\'s execution.

At 10 a.m., Colonel Francis Hacker instructed Charles to go to Whitehall, ready for his execution. Charles I\'s life and his execution has often been a subject of popular representations in the modern day. A large crowd had amassed outside the Banqueting House, where the platform for Charles\'s execution was set up. Charles\'s prosecutor, John Cook, published a pamphlet defending the execution of Charles, giving ""an appeal to all rational men concerning his tryal at the High Court of Justice"", in which he asserted that the execution had ""pronounced sentence not only against one tyrant but against tyranny itself"". Charles spent his last night restless, only going to sleep at 2 a.m.\nCharles awoke early on the day of his execution. could suggest either that he was inexperienced in the public execution of traitors, or that he simply feared identification from his voice.

There are three Sites of Special Scientific Interest within the parish:\n\nBlackhorse Quarry, a site of palaeontological interest which has produced many fossil bones and teeth, including those of Iguanodon and crocodiles. Darwell Wood, another site of biological importance as an example of hornbeam coppice with oak standards is partially within the parish. Battle is referenced in songs by the alternative rock band Keane, as several of the members grew up in the town. The Abbey is known as Battle Abbey, and was dedicated to St Martin, sometimes known as the ""Apostle of the Gauls"". This included the development of the first ever electric clock. This sold well for the rest of the 19th century. The remaining cloisters, part of the west range, were leased to Battle Abbey School shortly after World War I, and the school remains in occupancy.

He walked under guard from St James\'s Palace, where he had been confined, to the Palace of Whitehall, where an execution scaffold had been erected in front of the Banqueting House. On the day after the execution, the king\'s head was sewn back onto his body, which was then embalmed and placed in a lead coffin. The clean strike, confirmed by an examination of the king\'s body at Windsor in 1813, suggests that the execution was carried out by an experienced headsman. James VI was the first cousin twice removed of Queen Elizabeth I of England, and when she died childless in March 1603, he became King of England as James I. Charles was a weak and sickly infant, and while his parents and older siblings left for England in April and early June that year, due to his fragile health, he remained in Scotland with his father\'s friend Lord Fyvie appointed as his guardian. Parliament was reinstated, and the monarchy was restored to Charles I\'s eldest son, Charles II, in 1660. ""Charles I.

The architecture of Old Town Sacramento (formerly known as West End) exhibits observable characteristics similar to that of San Juan (Puerto Rico), Havana (Cuba), Tampico (Mexico), Seville (Spain), Santa Cruz de Tenerife (Canary Islands) and Madrid (Spain). Historic buildings\nNotable buildings include:\n\nB. F. Hastings Building, the National Historic Landmark western terminal of the Pony Express and the first location of the California Supreme Court; also housed the office of the Alta California Telegraph Company; features a branch of the Wells Fargo History Museum\nBig Four House, a National Historic Landmark building constructed through the joint efforts of California's railroad pioneers: Collis Huntington, Mark Hopkins, Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, known as The Big Four. Riverfront Park, located north of J Street, allows access to the water's edge. Regular events include the Sacramento Music Festival (formerly known as the Sacramento Jazz Jubilee), Gold Rush Days, New Year's Eve events, the St. Patrick's Day Parade, the World Music and Dance Festival and Mardi Gras. Old Sacramento State Historic Park occupies around one third of the property within the Old Sacramento Historic District of Sacramento, California. During this time, the paved streets are covered with several tons of dirt and automobile traffic is barred from the area. While the architectural style of Old Sacramento, with its wrought iron balconies and evenly spaced full-height windows may remind one of Paris, Sacramento's oldest buildings predate the Haussmann Projects that renovated large areas of Paris in that style. Other attractions available for visitors include rides in horse-drawn carriages, historic trains from the former Central Pacific Railroad passenger station, and cruises on historic riverboats. The State Historic Park comprises about a third of the total acreage of the district including half of the waterfront, a large grassy area and railroad features. Current attractions\nOld Sacramento is the site of the California State Railroad Museum, the California State Military Museum, the Sacramento History Museum, the Wells Fargo History Museum and the Old Sacramento Interpretive Center. Old Sacramento State Historic Park attracts over 5 million visitors annually. Booth Company Building also California Governor Booth's mansion. Memorials\nThe district contains many memorials to the founders of the city and of the California and transcontinental railroad and other transport systems, including the Theodore Judah monument and the Pony Express Statue. However, the Fort was some distance from the Sacramento River, which was the main means of transport to the coast of California, and the area that would become the modern city developed along the waterfront. A historic sternwheel riverboat, the Delta King, is moored in the river and serves as a hotel, restaurant and theater. Today, the Old Sacramento Historic District covers the area between the river frontage and Interstate 5, between I Street and the Capitol Mall. The Historic District is sometimes abbreviated as Old Sacramento, or Old Sac,  and since the 1960s has been restored and developed as a significant tourist attraction. This influence may be attributed to the fact that the period of Spanish, then Mexican, rule in California enjoyed immigration from all over the Atlantic, including Spain and the Canary Islands, and the Spanish colonies. Architecture\nWhile the architecture from this period is commonly attributed to Victorian gold miners, characteristics of West End, such as multi-storied buildings, large arched doorways, full-height balcony windows and the use of decorative wrought-iron balconies, were most ubiquitous in parts of Spain and the Spanish colonies. Virtually all the buildings in this area date from the 19th century, the most notable dating back to the period immediately after the disastrous fire of 1852, and show a reasonable approximation of their original appearance, though they have required varying degrees of reconstruction to restore to them to that state.

Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940–2020. A 2017 state legislative document states, ""Numerous theories exist as to the origin and meaning of the word \'California,\'"" and that all anyone knows is the name was added to a map by 1541 ""presumably by a Spanish navigator."" After the Portolà expedition, Spanish missionaries led by Father-President Serra set out to establish 21 Spanish missions of California along El Camino Real (""The Royal Road"") and along the California coast, 16 sites of which having been chosen during the Portolá expedition. Indigenous societies had terms such as two-spirit to refer to them. A Companion to California. It borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California. However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort. It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur). California\'s native grasses are perennial plants, and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state. From 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In October 2022, out of the 26,876,800 people eligible to vote, 21,940,274 people were registered to vote. California was the second state to recall their state governor, the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including Proposition 8 in 2008). Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research, making California the second state to legalize stem cell research, and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state\'s primary election process. The California High-Speed Rail Authority was authorized in 1996 by the state legislature to plan a California High-Speed Rail system to put before the voters. Once the state\'s Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for admission to statehood.

It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100% renewable energy, including heating, cooling and mobility, by 2050. In Southern California, Californios continued to resist American forces. From 1899 to 1939, California had exclusively Republican governors. It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060, primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration. Some land returns to indigenous stewardship have occurred. In the nineteenth century, a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the Gold Rush or to seek work. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of six terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of three terms. The many California state agencies that are under the governor\'s cabinet are grouped together to form cabinet-level entities that are referred to by government officials as ""superagencies"". The military action which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared California to be an independent state, and had been aided by Anglo-American residents of California, including Isaac Graham. The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest decreased from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 367,000 in 2011. Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah, perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti-Chinese riots in the state, and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.

In 1905, Archbishop Tikhon oversaw the creation of an Eastern Orthodox seminary in Minneapolis, Minnesota. This figure places the OCA as the 24th largest Christian church in the United States, and the second largest Eastern Orthodox church in the country, after the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. On 28 February 2022, he made an urgent appeal for OCA members to contribute to a fund to aid Ukrainian refugees to be administered by the Orthodox Church of Poland. :\u200a68\u200a In 2011, it had an estimated 84,900 members in the United States. Despite the lack of leadership, the Eastern Orthodox mission in Alaska continued to grow. The Orthodox Church in America (OCA) is an Eastern Orthodox Christian church based in North America. In 2000, a study by Alexei D. Krindatch, of the Patriarch Athenagoras Orthodox Institute, presented a substantially lower figure\u2009—\u2009115,100 adherents (baptized Orthodox who attend services on at least an occasional basis and their children) and 39,400 full members (persons older than 18, paying annual Church membership fees). In 1891, Alexis Toth brought a group of 361 Eastern Catholics into Eastern Orthodoxy. It has extensive data on various Eastern Christian denominations in the United States, including both Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox groups (as well as groups considered uncanonical by those two groups). While the subject of political and ecclesiastical dispute, this controversy does not impair the communion between the OCA and the wider Eastern Orthodox Church. By the late 19th century, the Russian Orthodox Church had grown in other areas of the United States due to the arrival of immigrants from areas of Eastern and Central Europe, many of them formerly of the Eastern Catholic Churches (""Greek Catholics""), and from the Middle East. According to the 2006 edition of the Yearbook of American and Canadian Churches, the OCA had 1,064,000 members, an increase of 6.4 percent from 2005. Unlike most Orthodox jurisdictions in the United States, the OCA does not have an affinity towards any particular foreign nationality, but most OCA members are ethnically Euro-American, and most OCA clergy are those who are born and raised in the United States. From then until his death in 1909, Toth brought approximately 20,000 Eastern Catholics from 65 independent communities to Eastern Orthodoxy. While the OCA is in full communion with most Eastern Orthodox churches in the world, the OCA\'s autocephaly is not fully recognized. Metropolitan Tikhon is a convert to the Eastern Orthodox faith and a long-time monk of St. Tikhon\'s Monastery in South Canaan, Pennsylvania. For his missionary and scholarly work that had focused on blending indigenous Alaskan languages and cultures with Orthodox tradition, Innocent became a saint of the Eastern Orthodox Church in America in 1977, and is referred to as the Enlightener of the Aleuts and Apostle to the Americas. Eastern Catholicism was viewed with suspicion by several Latin Church bishops in the United States; some, such as Archbishop John Ireland of Saint Paul, Minnesota, were actually hostile, especially concerning the matter of married clergy. By 1917, 163 Eastern Catholic parishes consisting of more than 100,000 faithful had been converted.

Members of the OCA and UOC held a joint vigil at the Chernivtsi Cathedral during this four day meeting. In 1918, a group of Ukrainians in Canada formed the Ukrainian Greek Orthodox Church in Canada, and in 1922, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America was established. Following Patriarch Tikhon\'s death, the Russian Orthodox Church, led by Metropolitan Sergius, began cooperating with the Soviet government. In 1926, the Serbs aligned with the Serbian Orthodox Church. The statement they released on the official website of the OCA detailed several administrative decisions Metropolitan Jonah had made that the Holy Synod felt put the church and its members at risk. On 10 April 1970, Patriarch Alexius I and fourteen bishops of the Russian Church\'s Holy Synod signed the official Tomos of Autocephaly, which made the newly renamed Orthodox Church in America the fifteenth autocephalous Orthodox Church. Growth\nIn 1868, the first Orthodox church in the contiguous United States was established in San Francisco, California. A third Russian church, the Synod of', 'From Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch:\n\'Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East for the Orthodox Rum\'), is an autocephalous Greek Orthodox church within the wider communion of Eastern Orthodox Christianity that originates from the historical Church of Antioch. But members of the community in Southern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon still call themselves Rūm (روم) which means ""Eastern Romans"" or ""Asian Greeks"" in Arabic. The Syriac Orthodox Church makes the same claim, as do the Syriac Catholic Church, the Maronite Church, and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church; the latter three are Eastern Catholic Churches in full communion with the Holy See and mutually recognize each other as holding authentic patriarchates, being part of the same Catholic communion. Both the Orthodox Churches of Antioch and Cyprus are members of the Middle East Council of Churches. Interaction with other non-Muslim ethnocultural minorities\nFollowing the fall of the Turkish Ottoman Empire and the Tsarist Russian Empire (long the protector of Greek-Orthodox minorities in the Levant), and the ensuing rise of French colonialism, communism, Islamism and Israeli nationalism, some members of the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch embraced secularism and/or Arab Nationalism as a way to modernize and ""secularize"" the newly formed nation-states of Northern Syria and Lebanon, and thus provide a viable ""alternative"" to political Islam, communism and Jewish nationalism (viewed as ideologies potentially exclusive of Byzantine Christian minorities). Its adherents, known as Antiochian Christians, are a Middle-Eastern semi-ethnoreligious Eastern Christian group residing in the Levant region including the Hatay Province of Turkey. Members of the community also call themselves \'Melkites\', which literally means ""monarchists"" or ""supporters of the emperor"" in Semitic languages – a reference to their past allegiance to Greco-Macedonian, Roman and Byzantine imperial rule. The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch (Greek: Ελληνορθόδοξο Πατριαρχείο Αντιοχείας), also known as the Antiochian Orthodox Church and legally as the Rūm Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East (Arabic: بطريركيّة أنطاكية وسائر المشرق للروم الأرثوذكس, romanized: Baṭriyarkiyyat ʾAnṭākiya wa-Sāʾir al-Mašriq li-r-Rūm al-ʾUrṯūḏuks, lit. Dual self-designation: ""Melkites"" and ""Eastern Romans""\nThe unique combination of ethnocultural traits inhered from the fusion of a Greek cultural base, Hellenistic Judaism and Roman civilization gave birth to the distinctly Antiochian ""Eastern Mediterranean-Roman"" Christian traditions of Cilicia (Southeastern Turkey) and Syria/Lebanon:\n\nThe mixture of Roman, Greek, and Jewish elements admirably adapted Antioch for the great part it played in the early history of Christianity. Some typically Grecian ""Ancient Synagogal"" priestly rites and hymns have survived partially to the present in the distinct church service, architecture and iconography of the Melkite Greek Orthodox and Greek Catholic communities of the Hatay Province of Southern Turkey, Syria and Lebanon. Many of their descendants now live in the global Eastern Christian diaspora. The head of the Orthodox Church of Antioch is called Patriarch. Their fellow Catholic particular church, the Latin Church, also appointed titular patriarchs for many centuries, until the office was left vacant in 1953 and abolished in 1964 with all claims renounced. Oriental Orthodox\nSyriac Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and all the East: Formed in 518 when Severus of Antioch was deposed by Emperor Justin I, and Severus and his followers went into exile. Various (sometimes secular) intellectuals with a Greek Orthodox Antiochian background played an important role in the development of Baathism, the most prominent being Michel Aflaq, one of the founders of the movement. And when the persecution arose about Stephen [a Hellenized Syrian-Cilician Jew, and one of the first known converts to Christianity], some of these Jews of Cyrene who had been converted at Jerusalem, were scattered abroad and came with others to Antioch [...] and one of them, Lucius, became a prophet in the early church there [the Greek-speaking \'Orthodox\' Church of Antioch]. Melkite Catholic Patriarchate of Antioch: Formed in 1724 by Cyril VI Tanas, who brought the Antiochian Orthodox community into communion with Rome. The Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch is one of several churches that lay claim to be the canonical incumbent of the ancient see of Antioch. But, in the modern era, the term tends to be more commonly used by followers of the Greek Catholic Church of Antioch and Alexandria and Jerusalem.

He is the third Olympic gold medalist wrestler in company history, after Mark Schultz and Kevin Jackson. Cejudo was coached for the Olympics by Kevin Jackson, the first Olympic gold medalist to win a UFC championship. As a senior level freestyle wrestler, he was also a 2007 Pan American Games gold medalist, as well as a multiple-time Pan American Championships gold medalist and US national champion. Cejudo went on to win the back-and-forth fight via split decision to become the second UFC Flyweight Champion and first Olympic gold medalist to win a UFC division championship. This made Cejudo the youngest American to win Olympic Gold in wrestling history at age 21 (record was later broken by Kyle Snyder, 20, in 2016). There, he had a hard-fought series with 04\' Olympic Silver medalist and defending Olympic team member Stephen Abas, whom he went 2–1 with, earning the US Olympic Team spot. There, he was downed twice by the 2000 Olympic silver medalist and 1998 World Champion Sammie Henson, losing the spot. Cejudo became inactive until 2020 due to a shoulder injury. Cejudo never slept alone in his own bed until he was provided one by USA Wrestling while participating in a residency program at the US Olympic Training Center in Colorado. Cejudo was scheduled to face José Aldo on May 9, 2020 at UFC 250. Cejudo faced a replacement in Dominick Cruz on May 9, 2020 at UFC 249. Despite wrestling at 121 pounds during his wrestling career, Cejudo fought at 135 pounds in his MMA debut. He then took a break from his freestyle wrestling career. At the 2012 US Olympic Team Trials, Cejudo downed Obe Blanc before being defeated by the top-seed Nick Simmons, failing to make his second US Olympic Team. Cejudo, along with his manager Ali Abdelaziz, fellow fighters Justin Gaethje and Colby Covington, and UFC President Dana White, all appeared at a rally for President Donald Trump in September 2020. He opted to pursue an international career in freestyle rather than competing in collegiate wrestling. Wrestling career\nEarly career\nInspired by his older brother Angel Cejudo, who was an undefeated four-time AIA wrestling state champion with a record of 150 wins and zero defeats who represented the United States internationally, Henry also became a four-timer. Other ventures\nCejudo made an appearance on the May 27, 2020 episode of AEW Dynamite alongside fellow MMA fighters Rashad Evans and Vitor Belfort to support Mike Tyson in confronting members of Chris Jericho\'s Inner Circle. In June 2018, Cejudo was prestigiously inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member. In the same year, he was selected in USA Wrestling Magazine\'s ""Dream Team of High School All-Americans."" He is considered to be among the greatest combat athletes of all time due to his accomplishments in MMA and freestyle wrestling. Soon after his victory, he began full-time training at the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado. At the US Olympic Team Trials, he started off by comfortably downing two opponents to make it to the best-of-three. Two months later, Cejudo confirmed he was in talks with AEW about potentially signing a contract, stating that he was also considering competing in amateur wrestling as well. Soon after his exhibition match with Ramos, Cejudo flirted with the possibility of making a 2016 Olympic Run, however, his intentions never materialized. His freshman and sophomore year titles were won in Arizona, before he moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado, to become a resident athlete at the United States Olympic Training Center. 2011–2012\nAfter announcing that he would try to make a second Olympic run in 2010, Cejudo made his comeback at the 2011 Beat the Streets charity event, where he beat Rasul Mashezov 2–0 and 4–3. Appearances post-retirement\nWhile already an undefeated MMA prospect, Cejudo made a brief return to the sport at the ""Agon V: Iowa against the World"" event by wrestling Tony Ramos (who would go on to win the US Open weeks later) on April 4, 2015, weeks after his win over Chris Cariaso at UFC 185.

gemini-pro,Who did the Canadian swimmer Eric Lamont compete against in Heat 3 of the freestyle competition that he was older than?,"['Who did the Canadian swimmer Eric Lamont compete against in Heat 3 of the freestyle competition that he was older than?', 'From Dead heat:\nFor example, in the final of the Women\'s 100 metre freestyle at the 2016 Summer Olympics, Penny Oleksiak and Simone Manuel finished in a dead heat for first place. The reason for this is that the length of lanes can vary by up to 3 centimetres (1.2 in), with lower-precision timing compensating for the possible differences between the distances competitors have travelled. Swimming has a relatively high number of dead heats because, under FINA rules (which includes Olympic events), positions are based on race timings which are limited in precision to hundredths of a second; this is despite the availability of technology that could provide further precision. Occurrence\nDead heats are very rare, and situations with three (or more) competitors in a dead heat are exceptionally so. A dead heat is a rare situation in various racing sports in which the performances of competitors are judged to be so close that no difference between them can be resolved. Outcome\nIf a dead heat is declared, all tied competitors are considered to have jointly achieved the superior position (unless a tie-breaking method is used to separate them). The rules of FIA-organised championships, for example, specify that a dead heat in a championship would result in all the World Championship points for the tied positions being added together and divided equally between the tied competitors. Prizes for the tied competitors may be divided. The result is declared a tie and the competitors are awarded a joint ranking. Occasionally racers will try to deliberately engineer a dead heat. See also\nList of dead heat horse races\nPhoto finish\n\n\n== References == Dead heats can occur in both head-to-head races and competitions where competitors race sequentially and are ranked by finishing time. Special provision is made for dead heats in the rules of sports betting: punters\' stakes are divided proportionally by the number of tied competitors. A heat which had no clear single winner was discounted from these tallies and was therefore ""dead"". During the mid-1940s, twin distance runners H. Ross Hume and Robert H. Hume became known as the ""dead heat twins"" for their practice of finishing their races hand-in-hand in intentional efforts to share victory. Complications can occur if the reward cannot be divided or duplicated: at the Women\'s 100 meters at the 2012 United States Olympic Track Trials, Jeneba Tarmoh and Allyson Felix finished in a dead heat for the third and final place in the US Olympic team, with there being no provision in the rules to resolve the situation (a head-to-head run-off was proposed, but Tarmoh eventually conceded the place). Photo finishes have been a long-standing method of resolving outcomes too ambiguous to be distinguished by the naked eye. Improvements in technology, including digital super-slow motion replay and pressure-sensitive digital timers, have increased precision in resolving dead heats. Consequently, dead heats are declared less often than they once were. Etymology\nThe Oxford English Dictionary attributes the term to horse racing. Meets formerly had the same horses run several ""heats"" in a day, with victors being decided by the total number of wins. The frequency of dead heats varies between sports, depending on the typical variance in performances and the precision of the technology available. The use of the photo finish, first introduced in horse racing in second quarter of the 20th century, notably decreased the number of dead heats. Both of the two recorded quadruple dead heats in horse racing occurred in England in the 1850s. At the 2002 United States Grand Prix in Indianapolis, Ferrari teammates Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher attempted to tie for first place, however Barrichello was adjudicated to have won by 0.011 seconds. In Formula One qualifying, dead heats have occurred only twice since times were recorded to the thousands of a seconds. At the 1997 European Grand Prix in Jerez, when Michael Schumacher, Jacques Villeneuve, and Heinz-Harald Frentzen all posted the same qualifying time. The positions were then determined based on who posted the time first, which resulted in Villeneuve acquiring pole position. 27 years later, the 2024 Canadian Grand Prix saw George Russell and Max Verstappen both posting the same time, but Russell, having set the time first, received the pole position. This does not affect awards for subsequent finishers. Both were awarded gold medals, no silver medal was awarded, and the next finisher, Sarah Sjöström, received bronze. For example, at the 2024 Monza Formula 2 round where Dennis Hauger and Gabriel Bortoleto both finished in 8th place in the sprint race, scoring 0.5 points each. In Grand Prix motorcycle racing, joint rankings are resolved by using fastest lap times as a tiebreaker. This rule resulted in Héctor Faubel winning the 125cc classification of the 2011 German motorcycle Grand Prix after a photo finish could not separate him and Johann Zarco.', 'From Adult Swim:\nTim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! On February 2, 2012, then-parent company TELETOON Canada Inc. announced that it would be launching a Canadian version of Adult Swim, sharing channel space with the Canadian version of Cartoon Network as one specialty channel just as its American counterpart does. The app contains the majority of Adult Swim produced content, including programming not seen on Canadian television. It broadcasts older Cartoon Network original series from the 1990s and 2000s, including those belonging to the Cartoon Cartoons brand. In it, there are more than 600 episodes of 19 different series such as Rick and Morty, Metalocalypse, Robot Chicken, among others. It was followed by the Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! Adult Swim introduced online video streaming in 2006, providing a free online video on demand service for recent and older episodes of select programming. The Canadian Adult Swim block was dropped on March 3, 2019, and Teletoon at Night closed on March 31, 2019. Older anime programming airs as a part of Toonami Rewind, a Friday afternoon block that launched on May 31, 2024, replacing the Friday showing of Checkered Past. On March 29, 2004, less than one year after beginning reruns on Adult Swim, Fox announced it would be renewing Family Guy for a fourth season and reviving it from cancellation. Via Adult Swim, Cartoon Network is one of the few U.S. networks to carry anime, and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children. Additionally, there is Channel 5, a live stream consisting of various Tim & Eric productions made for the network, along with original series made for the stream, TimAndEric.com sketches, content made for Jash, and the Super Deluxe series Tim and Eric Nite Live!. With the channel\'s launch, the Canadian block, as well as Teletoon at Night, were both discontinued as both channels would now focus exclusively on age-appropriate programming. Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, Samurai Jack proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a revival in 2017. New premieres are added soon after their U.S. broadcast, with the exception of new episodes of Robot Chicken and, initially, Rick and Morty, which are added the day after its premiere on the Canadian block. This block shows Adult Swim shows as well as some other shows being able to stream on Channel 4 such as Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!, Rick and Morty, and much more. Programming\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Off The Air, Home Movies, The Eric Andre Show, Rick and Morty, Smiling Friends, and My Adventures With Superman. It was quickly cut off due to its uncanniness, only for the channel to lose its ""remote"" and start ""fast forwarding"", showing previews of the new series Royal Crackers and the upcoming seasons of The Eric Andre Show and Teenage Euthanasia. As of March 2022, Adult Swim\'s current programming, excluding Rick and Morty (which is shared with Hulu), The Eric Andre Show (which is exclusive to Hulu), and Off the Air, is put on Max the day after new episodes air. Programs on the block include American Dad, Assy McGee, Lucy, The Daughter of the Devil, Metalocalypse, Moral Orel, Robot Chicken, Rick and Morty, Stroker & Hoop, The Brak Show, Venture Bros., Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and The Eric Andre Show. Shows that are currently airing on the channel, such as Aqua Teen Hunger Force, Birdgirl, Eagleheart, Mr. Pickles, Primal, Robot Chicken, The Eric Andre Show, The Shivering Truth, The Venture Bros., and YOLO: Crystal Fantasy, are available to stream for free on TVNZ+. On November 1, 2019, 2x2 announced an addition of the Adult Swim section on its site with library containing selected Adult Swim series broadcast earlier on the channel and also new series, like The Heart, She Holler, Off the Air, The Eric Andre Show, Dream Corp LLC, and Neon Joe, Werewolf Hunter, premiering directly on the site uncut. Adult Swim (stylized as [adult swim] and [as]) is an American adult-oriented television programming block aired by the American basic cable channel Cartoon Network during the evening, prime time, and late-night dayparts. The channel features stylistically varied animated and live-action series targeting an adult audience. The content includes original programming (particularly comedies and action series), syndicated series, and short films with generally minimal or no editing for content. Adult Swim is programmed by Williams Street, a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Television Studios that also produces much of the block\'s original programming. Launched on September 2, 2001, Adult Swim has frequently aired animated sitcoms, adult animation features, parody, satire, mockumentaries, sketch comedy, and pilots, with many of its programs being aesthetically experimental, transgressive, improvised, and surrealist in nature. Adult', 'From Phil Collins:\nHe starred in Frauds, which competed for the Palme d\'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival. He toured parts of Europe with Clapton in support of the album, of which two concert videos were released; Live at Montreux 1986 (Eric Clapton film) and Eric Clapton and Friends Live 1986. He produced and played drums on several tracks on Behind the Sun by Eric Clapton. "", and ""I Wish It Would Rain Down"" featuring Eric Clapton on guitar. Like Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, and Neil Young, Collins is a model railway enthusiast. Collins provided backing vocals, produced and played drums on most of Eric Clapton\'s 1986 album August. The film spawned the US #1 single ""Two Hearts"", which he co-wrote with Lamont Dozier and won the pair a Golden Globe for Best Original Song and an Oscar nomination in the same category. Collins is the youngest of three children: his sister Carole competed as a professional ice skater and followed her mother\'s footsteps as a theatrical agent, and his brother Clive was a noted cartoonist. In 2005 he donated autographed drumsticks in support of PETA\'s campaign against Kentucky Fried Chicken. Despite its success, the song was heavily criticised and became linked to allegations of hypocrisy made against Collins. In 2016, Bertorelli took legal action against Collins pertaining to his account of their relationship in his autobiography. In October 2020, Collins filed an eviction notice against Cevey after she secretly married another man in August. Collins is a member of the Canadian charity Artists Against Racism and has worked with them on campaigns including radio PSAs. Court case\nOn 29 March 2000, Collins launched a case against two former musicians from his band to recoup £500,000 in royalties that were overpaid. The final mission occurs during his concert, where the player must defend the scaffolding against saboteurs while Collins is performing ""In the Air Tonight"". He performed ""In the Air Tonight"" and ""Take Me Home"" at the Music for Montserrat benefit concert in London alongside Paul McCartney, Elton John, Eric Clapton, Mark Knopfler, and Sting. In the episode, Collins endorsed a hoax anti-paedophile campaign wearing a T-shirt with the words ""Nonce Sense"" and warned children against speaking to suspicious people. Tim Chester of the New Musical Express alluded to the backlash against Collins in an article titled, ""Is It Time We All Stopped Hating Phil Collins?"" 1984–1989: No Jacket Required and commercial ubiquity\nCollins wrote and performed on ""Against All Odds"", the main theme for the romantic film of the same name, which demonstrated a more pop-orientated and commercially accessible sound than his previous work. His most successful singles from the period include ""In the Air Tonight"", ""Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)"", ""One More Night"", ""Sussudio"", ""Another Day in Paradise"" and ""I Wish It Would Rain Down"". After performing what Ultimate Classic Rock called ""an especially crowd-pleasing selection of songs"" in London, including ""Against All Odds"", ""In the Air Tonight"", and playing alongside Sting, Collins flew to Philadelphia on a Concorde to perform his solo material, play drums for Clapton, and drum with Plant and Jimmy Page for a Led Zeppelin reunion. Philip David Charles Collins (born 30 January 1951) is an English musician, singer, songwriter, record producer and actor. He was the drummer and later became the lead singer of the rock band Genesis and had a successful solo career, achieving three UK number-one singles and seven US number-one singles as a solo artist. In total, his work with Genesis, other artists, and solo resulted in more US top-40 singles than any other artist throughout the 1980s. Born and raised in west London, Collins began playing drums at age five. During the same period he attended drama school, which helped secure various roles as a child actor. His first major role was the Artful Dodger in the West End production of the musical Oliver!. As an accomplished professional actor by his early teens, he pivoted to pursue a music career, becoming the drummer for Genesis in 1970 at age 19. He took over the role of lead singer in 1975 following the departure of Peter Gabriel. During the second half of the 1970s, in between Genesis albums and tours, Collins was the drummer of jazz rock band Brand X. Collins began a successful solo career in the 1980s, initially inspired by his marital breakdown and love of soul music, releasing the albums Face Value (1981), Hello, I Must Be Going (1982), No Jacket Required (1985) and ...But Seriously (1989). Collins became, in the words of AllMusic, ""one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the \'80s and beyond"". He became known for a distinctive gated reverb drum sound on many of his recordings. He played drums on the 1984 charity single ""Do They Know It\'s Christmas?

It was acquired by Naval Energies (then DCNS) in 2013, however, Naval Energies decided in July 2018 to stop developing tidal turbines and focus on floating wind turbines. The device is expected to be removed before the end of 2024 by the next company to test at FORCE Berth D, BigMoon Canada Corp.\n\nOther projects\nOpenHydro was about to develop the 14 MW Normandie Hydro project at La Raz Blanchard, Brittany, to be operated by EDF Energies Nouvelles. The company subsequently went into liquidation with debts of about €280m. In July 2018, a second 2 MW grid-connected turbine was installed. They were approved by the European Commission in July 2018 to receive funding from the French government. The test structure at EMEC was decommissioned and removed in the summer of 2024, with the piles cut off at the seabed by diamond wire cutting. Paimpol–Bréhat tidal farm\nÉlectricité de France (EdF) started to develop a tidal farm at Paimpol–Bréhat, Brittany, France that would use OpenHydro turbines. OpenHydro Group Ltd was an Irish developer of tidal stream turbines, established in 2004. In April 2014, OpenHydro and Alderney Renewable Energy announced plans to develop a 300 MW tidal array off the coast of Alderney in the Channel Islands. Naval Energies unveiled a new factory in Cherbourg-en-Cotentin, France alongside the International Conference on Ocean Energy (ICOE2018) just weeks before exiting the tidal energy market. OpenHydro was based in Dublin and had a manufacturing facility in Greenore, Ireland. OpenHydro developed an open-centred horizontal-axis turbine, surrounded by a ducting shroud which was claimed to have multiple benefits: increased flow through the turbine, helps align the flow through the turbine, and housed the rim-mounted direct-drive generator thus removing the need for a gearbox. Various iterations of the OpenHydro turbines were tested in Scotland, France, and Canada. Testing at EMEC\nThe first 250 kW Open Hydro turbine was tested at the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) Fall of Warness site from 2006, and was connected to the Orkney electricity grid in May 2008. The seventh generation 6 m diameter Open Hydro turbine was installed at the same EMEC site in April 2014. The turbine on test at EMEC was mounted on two piles, allowing it to be raised out of the water for maintenance, as shown in the photo (right). However, subsequent turbines sat on the seabed on a gravity foundation. A 250 kW turbine named L’Arcouest was tested there between December 2013 and April 2014. Two 16 m diameter 500 kW turbines were installed in January and May 2016, however these turbines were never connected to the grid. They were removed for repair in 2017 but not re-installed. The project was cancelled in 2018. The turbines were lowered to the seabed, and subsequently removed, by a specially designed catamaran barge, the OpenHydro Triskell. The turbine sat between the hulls, partially in the water. A 10 m diameter, 1 MW turbine was deployed in November 2009, however it suffered serious damage to the blades just 20 days later. A 2 MW grid-connected turbine was then tested from November 2016 to June 2017. This turbine was left on the seabed when OpenHydro filed for bankruptcy, suggesting it was damaged beyond repair. The array was expected to have 150 turbines, rated at 2 MW each.

The video\'s cast also consists of multiple transgender women, including Nef, Consani, and McGuire. Its music video received similar praise, winning the UK Music Video Award for Video of the Year and earning nominations for an MTV Video Music Award, an MTV Europe Music Award, and the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Charli XCX cast women who she ""felt embodied the personality of the record"" to star in the video. Social media users and critics compared its ensemble cast to that in Taylor Swift\'s 2015 music video for ""Bad Blood"", with Rhian Daly of NME opining that it ""felt so much more cutting-edge and exciting"" than ""Bad Blood"". Matthew Velasco of W described the video cast as ""a Mount Rushmore of reining [sic] internet cool girls"". Its Aidan Zamiri-directed music video stars an ensemble cast of online ""it girl"" influencers, models, and actresses, including Julia Fox , Gabbriette, Rachel Sennott, and Chloë Sevigny, and begins with a skit in which they meet at dinner to find a ""new hot Internet girl"". It was nominated at the at the Grammy Awards for Best Music Video, and the MTV Europe Music Awards for Best Video. Yung Lean and Charli XCX had been friends prior to releasing the remix.

Music Video\nSynopsis\nThe accompanying satirical music video for ""360"" begins with a skit in which Charli XCX gets invited by Gabbriette to Skyferrori\'s Trattoria, a fictional restaurant referencing the username of Twitter user @skyferrori. It was released in July 2024 with a music video of Aminé on vacation in Ischia. The music video was written and directed by Aidan Zamiri and filmed from March 11 to 12, 2024. Filming and production\nA promotional teaser for the ""360"" music video was released days prior to its premiere. Club\'s Drew Gillis wrote that ""360"" was ""a pretty standard music video"" that ""does land one coup with the appearance of Chloë Sevigny"". Sevigny appeared in it in between filming for the Netflix series Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story after a mutual friend between her and Charli XCX direct messaged her about the song and music video treatment. Stereogum named it the best song of the week of its release, with Danielle Chelosky writing that it ""sounds like friends having fun, not at all forced or insincere"" and praising Yung Lean\'s ""effortlessly magnetic intonations"", Robyn\'s ""charming"" verses, and Charli XCX\'s ""monotone rap"". Léa Zetlaoui, writing for Numéro, who named ""360"" one of the best music videos of 2024, wrote that Charli XCX\'s ""show of self-confidence and individuality"" in the video turned her ""into a new icon of pop culture"". Olivia Petter of The Independent deemed the music video for ""360"" the introduction to the ""brat identity"", which she wrote was ""fundamentally a celebration and interrogation of girlhood in all its complexities"", and Lindsay Zoladz of The New York Times called it ""instantly iconic"". Marisa Aron, Atlantic\'s VP of marketing, called ""360"" ""one of the most talked about music videos"" of 2024. Critical Reception\nIn an opinion piece on Brat for British Vogue, Mahoro Seward wrote in July 2024 that ""everything that has unfolded since the first minute of Aidan Zamiri\'s masterful music video for \'360\'""—which he likened to ""a vignette of what The Last Supper would have looked like if Jesus and his disciples were modern-day It-girls""—""amounts to a watershed moment in pop cultural history"". Make-up artist Isamaya Ffrench also appears in the video. Art direction for the video was done by Grace Surnow. Spilde surmised that the lyric was Charli XCX\'s way of expressing that ""she couldn\'t be more tired of critics conflating her ego-inflated persona with the quality of her music"". It was used in a viral TikTok video edit of then–U.S. Charli XCX hosted a screening for the video at Brain Dead Studios in West Hollywood. Charli XCX also raps that she, Robyn, and Yung Lean are ""three child stars out here doing damage"" with a ""really very special language"", as all three began their music careers as teenagers. Time\'s Cady Lang wrote that Charli XCX had ""summoned an Avengers-level cadre of \'It girls\'"" for the video, while Thom Waite of Dazed compared the video to a ""parallel-universe production of Euphoria or a 2020s it girl twist on Girls"". Its further lyrics reference several of her colleagues and friends: Cook (""You gon\' jump if A.

Hecox would later upload a video on the Smosh channel showing all the new cast members. Smosh saw a massive expansion of on-screen talent during this time, which also included more consistent appearances by their crew. History\n2002–2011: Comedy duo\nSmosh started as a website created by Anthony Padilla that he and his friends would use to upload Flash animations and talk to each other online. Despite Padilla\'s return, members of Smosh\'s team such as Topp, Miller, and Haas, would make recurring appearances on the channel. Much like the first group of new cast members, Miller and Topp were announced as joining the cast at the end of a main channel video on July 17, 2015. The three were announced as main cast members at the end of the main channel video ""APPLE WATCH SUCKS"" on March 13, 2015. On August 23, 2023, Smosh announced on Twitter that Jackie Uweh has left the cast to join The Second City in New York, while Kimmy Jimenez would confirm in a leaving video that she had left Smosh after having transitioned from being a cast member to a producer role at some point during 2023. Following Smosh\'s acquisition by Alloy Digital, the duo made plans to start Smosh Games; a new channel focused on video game news and let\'s play videos. 2023–present: Padilla\'s return and Smosh as an independent venture\nIn November 2022, Padilla and Hecox reconnected, and on June 20, 2023, the Smosh channel uploaded a video announcing that Padilla had returned to Smosh, and that they had purchased the channel and would be returning to their sketch comedy duo format. Initially starting as a comedy duo of Hecox and Padilla, the channel began expanding to include additional cast members starting in 2010, with the majority of new cast members joining after Smosh was acquired by Alloy Digital (later rebranded to Defy Media) in 2011. On January 1, 2024, Trevor Evarts of Mythical Entertainment announced on Twitter that he joined the Smosh cast. 2017–2018: Departures and Defy Media shutdown\nSmosh began to see cast members leave the company consistently throughout 2017 and 2018. During this time, both Johnson and Boze left, but the remaining cast stayed with the company while being independent. Later on that year long-time crew member, Tommy Bowe began to be referred to as a cast member in videos. Eventually, the two hired Mari Takahashi as the show\'s host, making her the first addition to the Smosh cast. New main cast members in this time included Kimmy Jimenez, Jackie Uweh, Amanda Lehan-Canto, Chanse McCrary, Angela Giarratana, and Arasha Lalani. As for their main channel, Padilla and Hecox began adding new cast members in 2015 with the addition of Keith Leak Jr., Olivia Sui, and Noah Grossman. To help run the channel, Alloy brought in three new cast members from the recently acquired Clevver Media; David ""Lasercorn"" Moss, Joshua ""Jovenshire"" Ovenshire, and Matt Sohinki. Smosh is an American YouTube sketch comedy-improv collective founded by Anthony Padilla and Ian Hecox. Padilla left the channel in 2017 to pursue his independent channel, while Hecox remained with Smosh through the merge with Mythical Entertainment. In June 2023, it was announced that both Padilla and Hecox had bought Smosh from Mythical Entertainment, and the two founders would resume working together on Smosh as an independent entity. Eventually, he was joined by childhood friend Ian Hecox when the two started their YouTube channel. The videos started as lip syncing to theme songs for various movies and TV shows, such as Power Rangers, Mortal Kombat, Pokémon, and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but as their uploads became more popular, they eventually transitioned to sketch comedy. 2011–2016: Expansion and Alloy Digital acquisition\nIn 2010, Smosh launched a new feature on their website called the ""Smosh Pit"", a blog that consisted of various pieces of pop-culture trivia, and written comedy. As part of this new feature, they also launched a new series on their second YouTube channel called ""Smosh Pit Weekly"" that summarized various articles posted on the website. Rather than hosting the series themselves, they recorded auditions for a host that were uploaded as a part of their ""Ian is Bored"" series, and let their fans vote on who they should pick. The channel launched on September 25, 2012, and continued to expand with additional members from 2014 to 2018, such as Amra ""Flitz"" Ricketts, Wes Johnson, Ericka ""Boze"" Bozeman, and Damien Haas. This group would eventually be followed by Courtney Miller and Shayne Topp later that year, which would complete the group that would be known as the ""Smosh Squad."" On June 14, 2017, Padilla announced that he would be leaving Smosh due to a lack of creative freedom.

During this time, he was a cheerleader and a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon, serving as the president of the fraternity during his senior year. In 2007, the United States entered the longest post-World War II recession. And the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon."" In 1972, Bush was suspended from flying for failure to take a scheduled physical exam. At the time, Cheney was serving as head of Bush\'s vice presidential search committee. In late 1972 and early 1973, he drilled with the 187th Fighter Wing of the Alabama Air National Guard. His father was Ronald Reagan\'s vice president from 1981 to 1989 and the 41st U.S. president from 1989 to 1993. He said that ""the United States of America will not permit the world\'s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world\'s most destructive weapons."" He graduated in 1975 with an MBA degree, and is the only U.S. president to have earned an MBA. 2008 financial crisis\nIn December 2007, the United States entered the longest post–World War II recession, caused by a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and other factors. The survey respondents gave President Bush low ratings on his handling of the U.S. economy, communication, ability to compromise, foreign policy accomplishments, and intelligence. On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight. Bush made regular appearances at various events throughout the Dallas–Fort Worth area, including the opening coin toss at the Dallas Cowboys\' first game in the new Cowboys Stadium in Arlington and an April 2009 Texas Rangers game, where he thanked the people of Dallas for helping him settle in, which was met with a standing ovation. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention in Haiti and Liberia to protect U.S. interests. In December, Bush travelled with President Obama to the memorial service of South African president and civil rights leader Nelson Mandela. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili was seated nearby. In addition, legal counsel to the president Harriet Miers and deputy chief of staff to the president Joshua Bolten were both found in contempt of Congress. The Justice Department determined that the President\'s order was legal. His paternal grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a U.S. senator from Connecticut. By the end of 2008, the U.S. had lost 2.6 million jobs. In 2003, the U.S. withdrew most of its troops from Saudi Arabia. Facing congressional opposition, Bush held town hall-style meetings across the U.S. to increase public support for his plan for a $1.35 trillion tax cut program, one of the largest tax cuts in U.S. history. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush\'s ""Mission Accomplished"" speech was later criticized as premature. The new directive allowed the National Security Agency to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S. and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant, which previously had been required by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Pickett was shot in the knee by a U.S. Secret Service agent and arrested. Bush remains the most recent president to have served in the military. The Bush administration\'s support for the unilateral declaration of independence of Albanian-majority Kosovo, while endearing him to the Albanians, troubled U.S. relations with Serbia, leading to the February 2008 torching of the U.S. embassy in Belgrade. Over the years, President Bush has had a good-natured friendship with Michelle Obama. In November 2002, Hans Blix and Mohamed ElBaradei led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks. The new rule was enacted in the wake of the Supreme Court\'s decision in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, 548 U.S. 557 (2006), which allowed the U.S. government to prosecute unlawful enemy combatants by military commission rather than a standard trial. Only four other U.S. presidents have left office with the stock market lower than when they began. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that American withdrawal from the ABM Treaty was a mistake. The provision of the law allowed the president to determine what constitutes ""torture"". He also did not attend the 2020 Republican National Convention where President Trump was re-nominated. On May 1, 2007, Bush used his second-ever veto to reject a bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, saying the debate ov', 'From George H. W. Bush:\nIn December 2020, the United States Mint honored Bush with a Presidential Dollar coin. Bush lay in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol from December 3 through December 5; he was the 12th U.S. president to be accorded this honor. At the time of his death he was the longest-lived U.S. president, a distinction now held by Jimmy Carter. Head of U.S. Liaison Office in China\nUpon his ascension to the presidency, Ford strongly considered Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, and Nelson Rockefeller for the vacant position of vice president. Bush, then-vice president, defended his country at the United Nations by arguing that the U.S. attack had been a wartime incident and the crew of Vincennes had acted appropriately to the situation. Chairman of the Republican National Committee\nAfter Nixon won a landslide victory in the 1972 presidential election, he appointed Bush as chair of the Republican National Committee (RNC). In 1972, during a controversy over whether the United States was intentionally bombing civilian hydrological infrastructure in Vietnam, Bush was sent by Nixon to convince Kurt Waldheim of the United States\' position. Bush Presidential Library and Museum, the tenth U.S. presidential library, was completed in 1997. During Bush\'s tenure at the RNC, the Watergate scandal emerged into public view; the scandal originated from the June 1972 break-in of the Democratic National Committee but also involved later efforts to cover up the break-in by Nixon and other members of the White House. In 1964, Bush sought to unseat liberal Democrat Ralph W. Yarborough in Texas\'s U.S. Senate election. By that time, HIV had become the leading cause of death in the U.S. for men aged 25–44. Invasion of Panama\nThrough the late 1980s, the U.S. provided aid to Manuel Noriega, the anti-Communist leader of Panama. NAFTA\nIn 1987, the U.S. and Canada reached a free trade agreement that eliminated many tariffs between the two countries. On July 13, 1985, Bush became the first vice president to serve as acting president when Reagan underwent surgery to remove polyps from his colon; Bush served as the acting president for approximately eight hours. He was also the third-oldest vice president. He became the fourth sitting vice president to be elected president and the first to do so since Martin Van Buren in 1836 and the first person to succeed a president from his own party via election since Herbert Hoover in 1929. Senator from Maryland, to force his brother, George Beall the U.S. Attorney in Maryland, to shut down the investigation into Agnew. Historians generally rank Bush as an above-average president. As the president of the Senate, Bush also stayed in contact with members of Congress and kept the president informed on occurrences on Capitol Hill. Bush accepted appointment as Chief of the U.S. Liaison Office in the People\'s Republic of China, making him the de facto ambassador to China. During Bush\'s year in charge of the CIA, the U.S. national security apparatus actively supported Operation Condor operations and right-wing military dictatorships in Latin America. After Panamanian forces shot a U.S. serviceman in December 1989, Bush ordered the United States invasion of Panama, known as ""Operation Just Cause"". The U.S. was not directly involved in these upheavals, but the Bush administration avoided gloating over the demise of the Eastern Bloc to avoid undermining further democratic reforms. Following the resignation of Vice President Agnew in 1973 for a scandal unrelated to Watergate, Bush was considered for the position of vice president, but the appointment instead went to Gerald Ford. Domestic affairs\nEconomy and fiscal issues\nThe U.S. economy had generally performed well since emerging from recession in late 1982, but it slipped into a mild recession in 1990. U.S. House of Representatives\nIn 1966, Bush ran for the United States House of Representatives in Texas\'s 7th congressional district, a newly redistricted seat in the Greater Houston area. The president was also damaged by his alienation of many conservatives in his party. Perot won 19% of the popular vote, one of the highest totals for a third-party candidate in U.S. history, drawing equally from both major candidates, according to exit polls. Richard Rose described Bush as a ""guardian"" president, and many other historians and political scientists have similarly described Bush as a passive, hands-off president who was ""largely content with things as they were"". He was a member of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity and was elected its president. The position represented Bush\'s first foray into foreign policy, as well as his first major experiences with the Soviet Union and China, the two major U.S. rivals in the Cold War. Former vice president Walter Mondale was nominated by the Democratic Party in the 1984 presidential election. As President, Bush regularly attended services at St. John\'s Episcopal Church in Washington D.C. A 2017 C-SPAN poll of historians also ranked Bush as th', ""From Inauguration of George H. W.

External links\nGeorge H. W. Bush announcement speech\nGeorge H. W. Bush acceptance speech The 1988 presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush, the 43rd vice president of the United States under President Ronald Reagan, began when he announced he was running for the Republican Party\'s nomination in the 1988 U.S. presidential election on October 13, 1987. The contradiction between Bush\'s words and subsequent actions as president formed the basis of an attack ad Bill Clinton ran against Bush in the former\'s successful 1992 presidential campaign. Primaries\nBush\'s three main opponents in the 1988 Republican Party presidential primaries were Senator Bob Dole (R-KS); Pat Robertson, an evangelist; and Representative Jack Kemp (R-NY). Bush was also successful in winning the New Hampshire primary against Dole on February 16, partly with help from the state\'s then-governor John H. Sununu, who successfully convinced many political figures in the state to support Bush by offering them low-digit license plates. After it became clear that Bush would be the Republican nominee, President Ronald Reagan endorsed him, saying in May 1988 that ""I\'m going to work as hard as I can to make Vice President George Bush the next president of the United States"". That year, the Republican Party platform stated, ""Our platform reflects George Bush\'s belief that military strength, diplomatic resoluteness, and firm leadership are necessary to keep our country and our allies free."" Bush\'s media advisor was Roger Ailes, who produced the ""Revolving Door"" attack ad for Bush\'s campaign. Personnel\nBush\'s campaign manager in 1988 was Lee Atwater, a political consultant who Bush subsequently named chair of the Republican National Committee after becoming the Republican nominee. After Bush\'s convincing performance on Super Tuesday on March 8, in which he won all 16 primaries, Dole dropped out of the race, making Bush the presumptive Republican nominee. The Bush campaign then decided to produce an attack ad against Dole. That fall, Bush focused extensively on the issues raised in these focus groups. Results\nBush did better in every southern state than Reagan had done in 1980. Bush won the 1988 election against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis on November 8, 1988. Reagan did not campaign strongly for Bush during the rest of the election, however. Message\nBush did not promise any major changes to the policies of then-sitting President Reagan. Atwater  persuaded Bush to go along with the ad by noting that Bush was behind Dukakis by 17 points at the time, warning him that ""You can get so far behind that even a good campaign won\'t win it for you."" Bush\'s support then began to deteriorate, partly because former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. had recently endorsed Dole. Subsequently, Bush became the probable Republican nominee, completing a transformation of his status from loser to front-runner in 29 days. During Bush\'s presidency, this remark came back to haunt him because he went on to raise taxes during his presidency. On the convention\'s second day, Bush announced that he had chosen Senator Dan Quayle (R-IN) as his running mate. Television advertising\nThe Bush campaign, and independent groups supporting it, made effective use of attack ads to reduce support for Dukakis. Bush was long held back by the widespread perception of him as a ""wimp"" who had only ever done the bidding of others. In that year\'s Iowa caucus, held on February 8, 1988, Bush finished in third, behind winner Dole and runner-up Robertson. His efforts to fight this perception included recruiting Roger Ailes to emphasize Bush\'s status as a World War II veteran, which Ailes did by producing a biographical ad. Bush\'s campaign focused on building a ""Firewall"" in the Southern United States, a strategy that proved successful after he won multiple primaries there on March 8. During his acceptance speech, Bush uttered the phrase ""Read my lips: no new taxes"", which was written by Peggy Noonan and served as the speech\'s centerpiece. By the end of the convention, Bush had increased his poll numbers to comfortably surpass those of Dukakis, and he went on to maintain that lead during the rest of his campaign. Ailes got the idea to make an ad portraying Dole as a ""straddler"" on the issue of raising taxes, based on one of Dole\'s own ads describing Bush with the same word. He was subsequently inaugurated as president on January 20, 1989. Endorsements\nConvention\nThe 1988 Republican National Convention was held in New Orleans, Louisiana. Shortly before his death, Atwater apologized for ', 'From Modesto Maidique:\nAppointed in 1986, Maidique was the longest-serving university president in Florida and the second longest-serving research university president in the United States . In 1989, US President George H. W. Bush appointed him to the President’s Educational Policy Advisory Committee, and served in a similar capacity for President George W. Bush. He holds three US patents for semiconductor devices. On November 14, 2008, Maidique announced his resignation from his post as President of FIU. Past president of FIU\nModesto Maidique was president of FIU for 23 years. He was the fourth president of Florida International University (FIU), a public university in the United States, whose main campus is named after him. On April 25, 2009, Mark B. Rosenberg was chosen to succeed Maidique and assumed office on August 3, 2009. Maidique serves on the boards of National Semiconductor and the Carnival Corporation.
