In 1941, prior to a SIAA championship game between the Racers and Hilltoppers, Murray State President James H. Richmond remarked, ""We are always happy when we can defeat our chief rival and greatest friend."" Hatcher became the fifth youngest coach in college football history, youngest in the 21st century, to reach 100 coaching victories. Following the 2006 season, he received the Frank Broyles Award, which is given annually to the top assistant coach in college football. Brockman closed out his college career by going 359-for-517 for 3,729 yards and 28 touchdowns, as well as rushing for seven touchdowns, during the 2012 season. According to an interview several years later with former Murray State president F. King Alexander, Alexander explained Pannunzio\'s departure by stating, ""I fired our football coach, Joe Pannunzio, because of numerous incidents that occurred in our program under him that were quite bad."" Shortly after he was announced as the new head coach at Murray State, Griffin was honored by the Tennessee Sports Writers Association as Tennessee\'s College Football Coach of the Year after making considerable improvement as head coach of the University of Tennessee at Martin.

Donner said that Murray was always in a professional mental state on set, believing it made him stressed, so the crew would do ""silly things"" to improve morale. Their review continued that Scrooged features ""wickedly amusing flashbacks"", but also some overwrought comic misfires. Plot\nOn December 23, Frank Cross, the ruthless and cynical president of IBC television, is preoccupied with ensuring the success of his extravagant live broadcast of A Christmas Carol scheduled for broadcast on Christmas Eve. Murray worked with scriptwriters Michael O\'Donoghue and Mitch Glazer (whom Murray had previously worked with on Saturday Night Live) until Murray was confident enough to begin filming. The film also features Murray\'s three brothers; Joel Murray cameos as a party guest, Brian Doyle-Murray plays Frank\'s father, and John Murray plays his on-screen brother James. Murray described his time on the film as ""misery"", while Donner called Murray ""superbly creative but occasionally difficult"". Critics were divided by Murray\'s performance. Murray was paid $6 million for his role. The production was rife with conflict between Murray and Donner. Murray said ""being a decent person is not that hard. Empire also called the ending embarrassing and beyond Murray\'s capabilities. ""Murray\'s \'Scrooge\' role that of a creep"". ""Bill Murray ain\'t afraid of no ghosts!"". Donner had not worked with an improvisational comedian like Murray before, who ad-libbed many of his lines, saying ""you don\'t direct [Murray], you pull him back"". Release\nThe film\'s marketing made references to Murray\'s role in Ghostbusters, with taglines including ""Bill Murray is back among the ghosts, only this time, it\'s three against one"". The production was tumultuous, as Murray and Donner had different visions for the film. Murray worked with Glazer and O\'Donoghue on reworking the script before agreeing to join the', ""From Rod Cameron (actor):\nComic book\nCameron's Western persona was popular enough that it attracted a comic book deal with Fawcett Publications. In State Trooper, a 1950s-style Western-themed crime drama, Cameron starred as Lieutenant Rod Blake of the Nevada State Police. As crime-busting federal agent Rex Bennett, Cameron battled enemy terrorists in 15 weekly episodes of G-Men vs. the Black Dragon. His early films include Heritage of the Desert with Donald Woods and Russell Hayden, Rangers of Fortune with Fred MacMurray, North West Mounted Police and Henry Aldrich for President with Jimmy Lydon. Television\nCameron starred in three syndicated television series: City Detective (1953–1955), State Trooper (1956–1959), and the Coronado 9 (1960–1961). 17 (Oct. 1952), the comic book featured two Rod Cameron stories, plus a one page humorous strip featuring the character Ambling Andy, and a story featuring Sam the Sheriff. Rod Cameron (born Nathan Roderick Cox; December 7, 1910 – December 21, 1983) was a Canadian film and television  actor whose career extended from the 1930s to the 1970s. He appeared in horror, war, action and science fiction movies, but is best remembered for his many Westerns. Early years\nCameron was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, and grew up in New Jersey. He played on his high school basketball team and on a semi-professional football team. Despite those activities and others such as swimming and playing ice hockey, he couldn't join the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in Canada as a young man because he failed the physical examination. Cameron moved to Los Angeles in the 1930s to work as a sandhog on the Metropolitan Water tunnels. Films\nCameron started out as a stuntman and was a body double for Buck Jones.

The southern boundary of the Yard was formed by the Anacostia River (then called the ""Eastern Branch"" of the Potomac River). During the War of 1812, the Navy Yard was important not only as a support facility but also as a vital strategic link in defense of the capital city. Women again entered the workforce in the 20th century in significant numbers during WWII, where they worked at the Naval Gun Factory making munitions. The Washington Navy Yard often functions as a ceremonial gateway to the nation\'s capital. The 1835 Washington Navy Yard labor strike was the first labor strike of federal civilian employees. In 1963, ownership of  55 acres of the Washington Navy Yard Annex (western side of Yard including Building 170) was transferred to the General Services Administration. The Yards at the Southeast Federal Center are part of this former property and now includes the headquarters for the United States Department of Transportation.

Building 126\nBuilding 126 is located by the Anacostia River, on the northeast corner of 11th and SE O Streets. It is the oldest shore establishment of the U.S. Navy, situated along the Anacostia River in the Navy Yard neighborhood of Southeast D.C. The waters of the Anacostia River were too shallow to accommodate larger vessels, and the Yard was deemed too inaccessible to the open sea. The first shipboard aircraft catapult was tested in the Anacostia River in 1912, and a wind tunnel was completed at the Yard in 1916. Civil War Era\nDuring the American Civil War, the Yard once again became an integral part of the defense of Washington. Following the war, most were discharged.

Production was encouraged and prices and markets were under tight federal control. However, there was little religious protest against the incarceration of Japanese on the West Coast or against segregation of Blacks in the services. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but the federal government was much less hostile than in the previous war.

The observing site that found this asteroid is part of a large observatory known for discovering a planet. What is the difference in years between the discovery of this asteroid and the discovery of the planet?', 'From New Horizons:\nCoincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto\'s moon Charon. Stamatios ""Tom"" Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory\'s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. Appointed as the project\'s principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as ""the personification of the Pluto mission"". Asteroid 132524 APL\nBecause of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter. When the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet, later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph\'s capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid\'s composition as well as light and phase curves. About 30 grams (1 oz) of Clyde Tombaugh\'s ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. In May 2006 it was discovered that New Horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras,', 'From Pluto:\nUpon the announcement of the discovery, Lowell Observatory received over a thousand suggestions for names. One Plutonian year corresponds to 247.94 Earth years; thus, in 2178, Pluto will complete its first orbit since its discovery. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. Marc W. Buie, then at the Lowell Observatory, petitioned against the definition. Percival\'s widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband\'s legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search, using mathematical calculations made by Elizabeth Williams, until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X\'s orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto\'s actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto\'s discovery that this was a coincidence. In 1906, Percival Lowell—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed ""Planet X"". She had suggested it to her grandfather Falconer Madan when he read the news of Pluto\'s discovery to his family over breakfast; Madan passed the suggestion to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues at Lowell on March 16, three days after the announcement. To make sure the name stuck, and that the planet would not suffer changes in its name as Uranus had, Lowell Observatory proposed the name to the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; both approved it unanimously. The name Pluto had received some 150 nominations among the letters and telegrams sent to Lowell. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet. Howeve', ""From Planets beyond Neptune:\nDiscovery of Pluto\nLowell's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Clyde Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. On 18 February 1930, after searching for nearly a year and examining nearly 2 million stars, Tombaugh discovered a moving object on photographic plates taken on 23 January and 29 January of that year. Planet X\nIn 1894, with the help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell (a wealthy Bostonian) founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Lowell's widow, Constance, engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell's legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years. Discovery of further trans-Neptunian objects\nAfter the discovery of Pluto and Charon, no more trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) were found until 15760 Albion in 1992. Pluto loses Planet X title\nTo the observatory's disappointment and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it appeared as a point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. In 1929 the observatory's director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Naval Observatory, to measure the mass of the Pluto–Charon system directly by observing the moon's orbital motion around Pluto. Because of Lowell's predictions, astronomers thought that Pluto would be massive enough to perturb planets. Lowell's prediction had been a coincidence: If there was a Planet X, it was not Pluto. In 1925, the observatory obtained glass discs for a new 13 in "", 'From Percival Lowell:\nFrom 1914 to 1916, a 9-inch (23 cm) telescope on loan from Sproul Observatory was used to search for Planet X.  Lowell did not discover Pluto but later Lowell Observatory (observatory code 690) would photograph Pluto in March and April 1915, without realizing at the time that it was not a star. In 1930, Clyde Tombaugh, working at the Lowell Observatory, discovered Pluto near the location expected for Planet X. Asteroid 1886 Lowell, discovered by Henry Giclas and Robert Schaldach in 1949, as well as the crater Lowell on the Moon and the crater Lowell on Mars, were named after him. He founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and formed the beginning of the effort that led to the discovery of Pluto 14 years after his death. As a result, Lowell and his observatory were largely ostracized. For the last 23 years of his life, astronomy, Lowell Observatory, and his and others\' work at his observatory were the focal points of his life. ""Lowell, Percival, Pickering, W. H. and the founding of the Lowell Observatory"". Lowell is buried on Mars Hill near his observatory. He also established the program and setting which made the discovery of Pluto by Clyde Tombaugh possible. The Lowell Regio on Pluto was also named in his honor after its discovery by the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015. In 2006, Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union. Partly in recognition of Lowell\'s efforts, a stylized P-L monogram (♇) – the first two letters of the new planet\'s name and also Lowell\'s initials – was chosen as Pluto\'s astronomical symbol. Pluto\'s mass could not be determined until 1978, when its satellite Charon was discovered. Beginning in the winter of 1893–94, using his wealth and influence, Lowell dedicated himself to the study of astronomy, founding the observatory which bears his name. This confirmed what had been increasingly suspected: Pluto\'s gravitational influence on Uranus and Neptune is negligible, not nearly enough to account f', 'From Lowell Observatory:\nAlso located on the Mars Hill campus is the 33-centimeter (13-inch) Pluto Discovery Telescope, used by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 to discover the dwarf planet Pluto.

The year 1853 saw a physical disaster that renders the books published by him in America prior to that date even more scarce today than would normally have been the case. Isle of the Cross is a possible lost work that was rejected for publication in 1853. After the disastrous publication of The Confidence-Man in 1857, Melville turned to the writing of poetry. Raymond Weaver, Melville\'s first biographer, edited a 16-volume edition for the London publisher Constable, which included the first publication of Billy Budd. In 1922, during the Melville revival, there was a complete resetting of the book for its publication in the Constable edition of Melville\'s Complete Works. That year was also the beginning of the long period of unpopularity precipitated by the appearance of Pierre in 1852 and exacerbated by the publication of The Confidence-Man in 1857. In the 1960s, Northwestern University Press, in alliance with the Newberry Library and the Center for Scholarly Editions of the Modern Language Association, established ongoing publication runs of Melville\'s various titles. The ""Editorial Appendixes"" for each volume included an ""Historical Note"" on composition and publication, an extensive account of the editorial process, a list of emendations and changes, as well as related documents.

Of these, seven books were published between 1846 and 1853, seven more between 1853 and 1891, and one in 1924.

The Joker is one of the few comic book supervillains to be represented on children\'s merchandise and toys, appearing on items including action figures, trading cards, board games, money boxes, pajamas, socks, and shoes. [The Joker] looks like Conrad Veidt – you know, the actor in The Man Who Laughs, [the 1928 movie based on the novel] by Victor Hugo. The Joker\'s Silver Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952\'s ""The Joker\'s Millions"". Voiced by Mark Hamill, the Joker retained the darker tone of the comics in stories acceptable for young children. Silver Age\nThe Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker\'s defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes. Like The Dark Knight before it, Joker grossed over $1 billion at the box office, breaking contemporary financial records, and earned numerous awards including an Academy Award for Best Actor for Phoenix. Bronze Age\nIn 1973, after a four-year disappearance, the Joker was revived (and revised) by writer Dennis O\'Neil and artist Neal Adams. Finger\'s, Kane\'s, and Robinson\'s versions acknowledge that Finger showed them an image of actor Conrad Veidt in character as Gwynplaine (a man whose mouth is disfigured into a perpetual grin) in the 1928 film The Man Who Laughs as an inspiration for the Joker\'s appearance, and Robinson produced a sketch of a joker pla', 'From Joker in other media:\nThis version is a patient at Arkham Asylum who provides Bruce Wayne with information regarding the Children of Arkham\'s attacks on Gotham City. The Joker, based on his Silver Age design as drawn by Dick Sprang, appears in Batman: The Brave and the Bold, voiced by Jeff Bennett. The Joker, based on Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal, appears in Batman: The Video Game. After losing his job for bringing a gun to a children\'s hospital, Arthur kills three Wayne Enterprises employees in self-defense, sparking city-wide protests, and gradually descends into insanity. The Joker, based on Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal, appears in the Batman (1989) tie-in game. The Joker, based on Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal, appears in the Batman (1990) arcade game. The Joker, based on Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal, appears in Batman (1990) for the Sega Genesis. Director Matt Reeves described this iteration of the Joker as deformed from an early age like Joseph Merrick, the Phantom of the Opera, and Gwynplaine from The Man Who Laughs (1928) and adept at using other people\'s horror to his advantage. The Joker makes a cameo appearance in the Batman: Caped Crusader episode ""Savage Night"", voiced by an uncredited voice actor. Mark Hamill, the voice of the Joker in various DC projects, said that he ""loved"" Leto\'s take on the character. The Joker, based on Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal (see above), makes a cameo appearance in Space Jam: A New Legacy. Additionally, Ledger was posthumously awarded the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. Ledger and Phoenix won the Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor, respectively, for their performances, making the Joker one of the only three characters played by two actors to be awarded an Oscar for both portrayals (the others being Vito Corleone from The Godfather and Anita from West Side Story). In Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), the Joker manifests as a split personality within Batman and four civilians, Henry Adams, Johnny Charisma, Christina Bell, and Alber', 'From The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus:\nEffects of Heath Ledger\'s death\nProduction was halted by the death of Heath Ledger in New York City on 22 January 2008. In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick\'s property at the age of 16. Cast\nHeath Ledger as Tony Shepard. ... That\'s what\'s funny, when Johnny appears so many people think it\'s Heath! Depp, Farrell, and Law opted to redirect their wages for the role to Ledger\'s young daughter, Matilda, who had been left out of an old version of Ledger\'s will, and Gilliam altered the part of the credits saying ""A Terry Gilliam film"" to ""A film from Heath Ledger and friends."" It\'s really a love letter to Heath by everybody involved. The film stars Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer, Verne Troyer, Andrew Garfield, Lily Cole, Tom Waits, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law, though Ledger\'s death one-third of the way through filming caused production to be temporarily suspended. Ledger\'s involvement had been a ""key factor"" in the film\'s financing. A child in rags disrupts their trip, transitioning the scene to one of Tony as a philanthropist, speaking at a fundraiser for impoverished children. Ledger\'s footage would remain in the film as his character\'s ""real-world"" appearance. Mr. Nick offers Parnassus a new wager: Valentina can stay with Parnassus past the age of 16 if Parnassus wins five souls before Mr. Nick. It was really [...] people\'s love for Heath that propelled this thing forward."" Gilliam wrote lyrics for the two songs ""We Love Violence"" and ""We Are the Children of the World"", the latter of which spoofed Michael Jackson\'s famous ""We Are the World"" and was nominated for a 2009 Satellite Award in the category ""Best Original Song"". Law was also a friend of Ledger\'s and had been considered for the role of Tony, and Farrell had also been friends with Ledger.

Under the contract the private resort operator owns all the equipment and facilities but pays rent for use of the park land. The name Enqvist was later spelled Enquist giving name to ""The Enquist Lodge"" and ""Enquist Tube Park"" among other facilities. Mount Seymour\'s Enquist Cabin, located in the Tube Park Parking Lot was destroyed in a fire in the late spring of 2005. The Government did not have the experience to run a ski area, so, they issued Mr. Enqvist the first Park Use Permit to operate the area. It is a part of the North Shore Mountains, rising to the north from the shores of Burrard Inlet and Indian Arm to a summit of 1,449 m (4,754 ft) above the Indian River and Deep Cove neighbourhoods. Mount Seymour is most commonly identified for its ski area of the same name, and as a popular hiking area. It is named in honour of Frederick Seymour, second governor of the Colony of British Columbia. The name is used to refer to the ridge although the main summit is one of several, and is also known as Third Peak. The parking lot and a small shelter and bulletin board became the starting point for early hiking and skiing.

The former route of the Cypress Street Viaduct was reopened as the ground-level Mandela Parkway. State Route 17: Over half of the 26-mile (42 km) highway was closed for about one to two months because of landslides that occurred between Granite Creek Road in Scotts Valley and State Route 9 in Los Gatos (only Buses and carpoolers with three or more people could cross it).

Established with the intention to be a museum of national interest, the institution sought to preserve historical records and materials relating to the Canadian Militia, and any of its colonial predecessors.

From 1989 to 1998, he played Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld, three times receiving the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series. In Seinfeld, Kramer is the neighbor across the hall of the show\'s eponymous character, and is usually referred to only by his last name. In 2012, he appeared in the comedy web series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee, hosted by Seinfeld, in which he remarked on the 2006 incident. In 2009, he appeared as himself in the seventh season of Curb Your Enthusiasm alongside his fellow Seinfeld cast members for the first time since the show’s finale.

Together they had a son named Triton, a merman. Theseus killed the Minotaur, and in time succeeded his father Aegeus as king of Athens. Burkert noted :""In cult, Poseidon was identified with Erechtheus"" and ""the myth turns this into a temporal-causal sequence: in his anger at losing, Poseidon led his son Eumolpus against Athens and killed Erectheus."" The monster was later killed by Heracles. By an Amazon he had a son, Hippolytus, while his wife Phaedra (Minos\' daughter) gave him two sons. The five children emerged from their father\'s belly in reverse order, making Poseidon both the second youngest child and the second oldest at the same time. In the Odyssey, Poseidon is notable for his hatred of Odysseus who blinded the god\'s son, the Cyclops Polyphemus. The sacrifices offered to Poseidon consisted of black and white bulls which were killed or thrown into the sea. Meanwhile, in Crete, Zeus\'s son Minos asked for Poseidon\'s help in order to certify his claim on the throne of Crete. Poseidon also had an affair with Alope, his granddaughter through Cercyon, his son and King of Eleusis, begetting the Attic hero Hippothoon. Rape and assault victims\nA mortal woman named Tyro was married to Cretheus (with whom she had one son, Aeson), but loved Enipeus, a river god. Theseus, not knowing the truth, asked his father to destroy Hippolytus; Poseidon granted his son\'s wish, and as Hippolytus was driving by the sea, Poseidon sent a terrifying sea monster to spook the man\'s horses, which then dragged him to his death.

The 318 cubic-inch V8 became the standard engine for the first time. The 1969 Monaco offered, as a $50 option, the first modern polyellipsoidal (projector) automotive road lamp. 1978\nFor the 1978 model year, the mid-size B-body 1978 Dodge Monaco was unchanged from the previous model year. First generation (1965–1968)\n1965\nUpon its introduction on September 25, 1964, for the 1965 model year, the Dodge Monaco was intended to compete with the Pontiac Grand Prix in what came to be known as the personal luxury market, but ended up filling in for Dodge in the full-size, luxury line instead. This was the first time they had used the ""Chrysler"" badge on a locally built product in ten years. The 1973 model year was to be the Monaco\'s final year as Dodge\'s top-of-the-line full-size car. The Monaco 500 was dropped at the end of the 1968 model year in the United States and at the end of the 1970 model year in Canada. The previous model year\'s full-size C-body Dodge Monaco (from 1976) became, just for one year only, the full-size C-body 1977 Dodge Royal Monaco until its discontinuation from all production at the end of the 1977 model year. The Monaco was replaced by the Dodge Intrepid for the 1993 model year. The Dodge Monaco was discontinued at the end of the 1978 model year. 1975\nFor the 1975 model year, changes to the base Monaco were minimal. It became Dodge\'s largest car during the 1978 model year. The Premier began production in September 1987 for the 1988 model year. 1975 was the last model year in which the four-door hardtop was available. 1967\nThe 1967 model year full-sized Dodges, the Monaco included, received significant facelifts with all-new exterior sheet metal.

The four-door sedan was manufactured from September 1987 (for the 1988 model year) until December 1991 (for the 1992 model year). For example, the vehicle identification number for the entire 1988 model year production retained AMC format. Model years\n1988\nThe Eagle Premier was launched in January 1988, with the first production models rolling off the assembly line on 28 September 1987. A companion two-door coupe, code named ""X-59"", was to debut for the 1988 model year. 1989\nThe second model year the Premier saw almost no other changes except for the addition of cruise control and the mid-year introduction of an ES Limited model featuring monochromatic paint and body-colored trim. A badge engineered version of the Premier was added using a familiar Chrysler name, the Dodge Monaco, a moniker that was first used by Dodge in 1965 and last used in 1978 on a full-size, rear-drive sedan. 1992\nThe Eagle Premier and its badge engineered variant, the Dodge Monaco, continued mostly unchanged for 1992, except every model received the grille and tail lamps that were only on the Limited in 1991.> Chrysler also announced it would be the Premier\'s final year as the automaker prepared to launch all its new LH models in the Bramalea assembly plant. The ""sporty"" two-door companion model that was announced by Iacocca for this model year to ""get the Eagle soaring"" with new products and a ""brand personality that\'s unique ...and exciting... and upscale"" was not released. The introduction of a rebadged model named Dodge Monaco resulted from a contractual obligation to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. Bramalea ended Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier output on 17 December 1991. A rebadged variant was also marketed as the Dodge Monaco from 1990 until 1992.

Coulthard did not score in the next four races, which included consecutive retirements in Monaco and at the Nürburgring. Personal life\nCoulthard has lived for some time in Monaco, and also owns homes in London, Belgium and Switzerland. Coulthard overcame these setbacks and finished on the podium in the next five races, which included victories in Britain and Monaco. He followed the result with a second-place finish in the wet race at Monaco before suffering a first-lap accident in the wet race in Spain. Coulthard borrowed a helmet belonging to Michael Schumacher for the 1996 Monaco Grand Prix as his regular helmet was suffering from steaming up during the weekend. The start managed to get better as Coulthard took four consecutive finishes inside of the points; this included his only victory of the season in Monaco. Coulthard later revealed a pre-race agreement by the team that whoever led into the first corner on the first lap would be allowed to win the race. Coulthard was involved in a multi-car collision on the first lap in Italy. Coulthard began the season by scoring points in four of the first five races. He moved to Red Bull in 2005 and secured their first podium a year later. He followed this up by scoring his first points with a fifth-place finish in Canada.

The Chiefs' first possession resulted in a punt after a three-and-out. This was the first Super Bowl to be held in the state of Nevada. This game was also the first since Super Bowl LV to feature the defending champion. They fumbled on first down but recovered it themselves for a ten-yard loss on the play. The Chiefs became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the 2004 New England Patriots. In Poland, the game was televised by free-to-air station Polsat, its first Super Bowl broadcast. The 49ers were the first team in league history to have four players with over 1,000 scrimmage yards.

The suit questioned the constitutionality of the stadium\'s funding plan and delayed a $468 million bond sale. Super Bowl LII was played at the stadium on February 4, 2018 between the Philadelphia Eagles and the New England Patriots with the Eagles winning 41-33 for their first Super Bowl win. 2009\nFeasibility studies for Dallas-based design and local construction of a new stadium were expected in early 2009.

On October 15, 2024, the NFL announced that the stadium will host Super Bowl LXII in 2028. The stadium incorporates contemporary art into its interior and exterior design, with over 180 commissioned works, including pieces by Nari Ward, Hank Willis Thomas, and Steven and William Ladd.

The Falcons unveiled a conceptual design for the new stadium on June 18, 2013, with a proposed capacity of 70,000 spectators, 7,500 club seats, and 180 luxury suites. According to the master plan, the stadium would have a regular capacity of 71,000, but can expand to 75,000 for special events such as the Super Bowl. The team was pursuing a new stadium because of the team\'s desire to play outdoors, as well as Falcons team owner Arthur Blank\'s interest in hosting another Super Bowl. However, the bridge was not open for the Super Bowl as it was deemed a security risk.

All of Anne\'s children died young, so during her reign, Parliament settled the rules of succession in the Act of Settlement 1701, by defining Sophia of Hanover (granddaughter of James VI and I) and her non-Catholic descendants as the future royal heirs. Her total reign lasted 12 years and 147 days. Union and succession\nQueen Anne became monarch of the Kingdom of Great Britain after the political union of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707. On 1 January 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged, creating first the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and later the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland upon the secession of southern Ireland in the 1920s. Although Anne\'s great-grandfather, James VI and I (r.\u20091603–1625), the monarch of the Union of the Crowns, proclaimed himself ""King of Great Britain"", and used it on coinage, stamps and elsewhere, the Parliament of England had refused to use that style in statutory law or address. She continued as queen of Great Britain and Ireland until her death. She had ruled England, Scotland, and the Kingdom of Ireland since 8 March 1702. Queen Anne and King George I were second cousins, as both were great-grandchildren of James VI and I. For a family tree that shows George I\'s relationship to Anne, see George I of Great Britain § Family tree. England and Scotland had been in personal union since 24 March 1603; while the style, ""King of Great Britain"" first arose at that time, legislatively the title came into force in 1707. The Crown passed from Queen Anne to Sophia\'s son, K', ""From List of longest-reigning monarchs:\nSee also\nList of centenarians (politicians and civil servants)\nList of oldest living state leaders\nList of shortest-reigning monarchs\nLists of state leaders\nLists of state leaders by age\nRecords of heads of state\n\nNotes\nReferences\nSources\nJürgen von Beckerath (1997).

Monarchs of sovereign states with verifiable reigns by exact date\nThe following are the 25 longest-reigning monarchs of states who were internationally recognised as sovereign for most or all of their reign. Thus, this table does not present a precise ranking by total length of reign. This is a list of the longest-reigning monarchs in history, detailing the monarchs and lifelong leaders who have reigned the longest, ranked by length of reign. In a given year, there may have been a wide array of actual reign lengths based on days. Monarchs of dependent or constituent states with verifiable reigns by exact date\nThe table below contains 100 monarchs of states that were not independent sovereigns for at least a portion of their reigns. Regencies are not counted against monarchs, hence Louis XIV is listed first among the monarchs of sovereign states despite his mother Anne of Austria being his regent for eight years. Japanese legendary emperors, according to the ancient Japanese calendar, reigned for very long terms of 60–70 years each. The longest ruler of the legendary emperors, Emperor Kōan, was claimed to have reigned for about 101 years. The currently living longest-reigning monarch, Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei, is not included on the list because Brunei was not a sovereign state until 1984. Bolkiah will be eligible for inclusion if he is still reigning in 2040 and surpasses Conrad I's independent rule of 56 years, 99 days. The list is limited to those that might reasonably be expected to lie within the range of those in the tables above, at minimum 56 years.

Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I, irredentist and revanchist nationalism had emerged in several European states. History\nBackground\nAftermath of World War I\nWorld War I had radically altered the political European map with the defeat of the Central Powers—including Austria-Hungary, Germany, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire—and the 1917 Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia, which led to the founding of the Soviet Union. Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower. The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I. Land warfare changed from the static frontlines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms. Following Hindenburg's death in 1934, Hitler proclaimed himself Führer of Germany and abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian Empires.

A 48th state, Alabama, had plurality support (defined as more supporters than opponents, with neither side reaching 50%). The rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) people in the United States are among the most advanced in the world, with public opinion and jurisprudence changing significantly since the late 1980s. In 1962, beginning with Illinois, states began to decriminalize same-sex sexual activity, and in 2003, through Lawrence v. Texas, all remaining laws against same-sex sexual activity were invalidated. In 2004, beginning with Massachusetts, states began to offer same-sex marriage, and in 2015, through Obergefell v. Hodges, all states were required to offer it. In many states and municipalities, LGBTQ Americans are explicitly protected from discrimination in employment, housing, and access to public accommodations. Many LGBTQ rights in the United States have been established by the United States Supreme Court, which invalidated state laws banning protected class recognition based upon homosexuality, struck down sodomy laws nationwide, struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, made same-sex marriage legal nationwide, and prohibited employment discrimination against gay and transgender employees. LGBT-related anti-discrimination laws regarding housing and private and public services vary by state. Twenty-three states plus Washington, D.C., Guam, and Puerto Rico outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation, and twenty-two states plus Washington, D.C., outlaw discrimination based on gender identity or expression. Family law also varies by state. Adoption of children by same-sex married couples is legal nationwide since Obergefell v. Hodges.

In September 1995, after internal conflict with Atlantic Records over controversy concerning the label\'s support of gangsta rap, the label and its former parent company at the time, Time Warner made the decision to sell off its share in Interscope to Iovine and Field. As a result, Interscope was placed in the same company portfolio of labels alongside future sister label Geffen Records, MCA Records, Universal Records and DreamWorks Records. His father\'s death and love for Christmas inspired Iovine to record and oversee A Very Special Christmas in 1985. The company had captured 20 percent market share of the headphones industry by 2012.

Design\nThe early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents, as is the custom now; although today, by law, only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency. The U.S. dollar has since floated freely on the foreign exchange markets. After the adoption of the United States Constitution, the U.S. dollar was defined by the Coinage Act of 1792. Coinage Act of 1792\nOn July 6, 1785, the Continental Congress resolved that the money unit of the United States, the dollar, would contain 375.64 grains of fine silver; on August 8, 1786, the Continental Congress continued that definition and further resolved that the money of account, corresponding with the division of coins, would proceed in a decimal ratio, with the sub-units being mills at 0.001 of a dollar, cents at 0.010 of a dollar, and dimes at 0.100 of a dollar. Congress exercised those powers when it enacted the Coinage Act of 1792. The Coinage Act of 1792 introduced the U.S. dollar at par with the Spanish silver dollar, divided it into 100 cents, and authorized the minting of coins denominated in dollars and cents. The Monetary policy of the United States is conducted by the Federal Open Market Committee, which is composed of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and 5 out of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank presidents, and is implemented by all twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks.

Roosevelt (1946–present)\nSoon after the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt in April 1945, legislation was introduced by Virginia Congressman Ralph H. Daughton that called for the replacement of the Mercury dime with one bearing Roosevelt\'s image. The obverse of the current dime depicts the profile of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and the reverse has an olive branch, a torch, and an oak branch, from left to right respectively. The first known proposal for a decimal-based coinage system in the United States was made in 1783 by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, Alexander Hamilton, and David Rittenhouse. Due to the limited amount of time available to design the new coin, the Roosevelt dime was the first regular-issue U.S. coin designed by a Mint employee in more than 40 years. The same rumor arose after the release of the Sinnock designed Franklin half dollar in 1948. The denomination was first authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792.

The Roosevelt dime has been minted every year, beginning in 1946. The first change was made in response to rising silver prices, while the latter alteration was brought about by the Mint Act of 1873 which, in an attempt to make U.S. coinage the currency of the world, added a small amount of mass to the dime, quarter, and half-dollar to bring their weights in line with fraction']",Franklin Delano Roosevelt (12 years).,The provided text does not have information about which president featured on a U.S. coin in 1972 served the longest as President of the United States of America.,0.44454747438430786,False,6,

Future development and Clyde Metro\nThe Glasgow Subway system is the only metro system never to have been expanded from its original route in 125 years, although a report published in 2018 summarised various extension plans from 1937 onwards. The expansion of the existing network was also considered at a cost of £2.3 billion, including a new East End Circle, with seven new stations at St Mungo\'s, Onslow, Duke Street, Celtic Park, Dalmarnock, Newhall and Gorbals. Further plans were announced to modernise Ibrox and Kelvinhall stations before the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow. Glasgow Central and Argyle Street railway stations (for the Argyle Line) are both a short walk from St Enoch subway station, and most stations connect with bus routes. Anderson attributes this, and an increase in patronage in the years leading up to the conflict, to the expansion of the local shipyard workforce due to the need for rearmament. The modernised system uses automatic train operation with the driver only responsible for closing the doors pressing a ""start"" button in normal operation. The Glasgow Connectivity Commission, established by Glasgow City Council in 2017, has also suggested a Glasgow Metro. Breakdowns were becoming increasingly frequent; because trains could only be removed from the tracks to the depot by crane, a single inoperable train could cause major delays. The Glasgow Subway is an underground light metro system in Glasgow, Scotland.

An SPT study into a possible expansion of the subway has been mooted. Motorway network\nGlasgow is a focal point of Scotland's motorway network. Strathclyde Passenger Transport published a set of plans for this system, going so far as to distribute pamphlets across the city outlining these plans and the proposed routes. Plans were devised in the post-war period to redevelop Glasgow as a whole. Much of this expansion might utilize disused railway tunnels that have been abandoned since the Beeching cuts of the 1960s. Future plans\nLocals have long pressed for a link which will join the two halves of the urban railway network together, making possible through journeys via the central area without having to disembark at either Central or Queen Street and traverse the city centre by foot or road. Glasgow and District Transport Plans from 1951 show the layout of the proposed station, available on: Hipkiss' Scanned Old Maps.

This was far more extensive than Network Rail's proposal, calling for a full, integrated high-speed network totalling around 1,500 km (930 mi). HS2's original proposal was for a Y-shaped network between London and England's major regional cities, serving Manchester, Birmingham, Leeds, East Midlands, with connections on to the West Coast and East Coast main lines to allow through services to Liverpool, York, Newcastle, Edinburgh and Glasgow. High-Speed Scotland – the Scottish route would be a corridor between Edinburgh and Glasgow, consisting of entirely new-build line.

The modern game of association football originated in the mid-nineteenth century by the efforts of English football clubs to standardize the varying sets of football rules, culminating in the formation of The Football Association (The FA) in London, England, in 1863, and their issuing of the Laws of the Game in the same year. The existing League clubs, plus three of the strongest Alliance clubs, comprised the Football League First Division. The meetings were held in London, the main concern was that an early exit in the knockout format of the FA Cup could leave clubs with no matches for almost a year, and if that happened, not only could they suffer heavy financial losses, but fans often didn't stick around for that long without a g"", ""From Michael Owen:\nMichael James Owen (born 14 December 1979) is an English former professional footballer who played as a striker for Liverpool, Real Madrid, Newcastle United, Manchester United and Stoke City, as well as the England national team. In 2001, Liverpool won a cup treble of the UEFA Cup, FA Cup (with Owen scoring two late goals in the final) and Football League Cup, and Owen was the recipient of the Ballon d'Or. He became the most recent English winner of the European Footballer of the Year award, and the first Englishman to win the award since Kevin Keegan in 1979. In June 2022, his oldest daughter Gemma, now 19, took part in series 8 of ITV reality show Love Island where she finished in second place. 2000–2002: Ballon d'Or and continental treble\nOwen helped Liverpool to a treble in 2000–01, as the team won the League Cup, FA Cup and UEFA Cup to end a six-year trophy drought. Liverpool were 3–0 down after only 50 minutes in the second leg, but with Owen taking control of the match and scoring twice, the team ran out as 7–5 winners. His father is a former professional footballer and played for clubs such as Chester City and Everton. He scored a hat-trick against FA Youth Cup holders Manchester United in the quarter-finals, scoring the winner in extra time. By September 2006, Newcastle were threatening to sue the FA for further compensation, for a reported figure of £20 million. Style of play\nIn his prime, Owen was highly regarded for his great pace, opportunism and agility, as well as his technical ability and his eye for goal, which enabled him to be considered one of the greatest English and Premier League strikers of his generation. Under the transfer rules, with the 2008–09 season being the final year of his contract with Newcastle, Owen would have been allowed to sign a pre-contract agreement with other clubs during January.

His final season was spent in the Irish League B Division (which was then the second-tier of football in Northern Ireland) with Newry Town, where he scored 32 goals in 32 games before retiring in 1965 with a national domestic record of 647 goals. Early life\nJones was born in his maternal grandmother's home in Keady, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, the only child of Thomas Jones, a police sergeant, and his wife Ellen (née Wilson). He was the leading Irish League goalscorer for some years in the fifties, and finished as Irish League outright leading goalscorer in six seasons (a record still unbroken), during the most successful period in Glenavon's history where they won the Irish League championship and Irish Cup three times each. He remains the leading goalscorer in Irish league history.

History\nOn 18 February 1882, 15 months after the founding of the Irish FA, Ireland made their international debut against England, losing 13–0 in a friendly played at Bloomfield in Belfast. On 8 March 1950, however, in a 0–0 draw with Wales at the Racecourse Ground in a FIFA World Cup qualifier, the IFA fielded a team that included four players who were born in the Irish Free State. People like Stewart are the unsung heroes who have been brave enough to challenge sectarianism and who have actively created a more fun, safe and family-orientated atmosphere at international games. On 25 February 1882, Ireland played their second international, against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, and an equaliser from Johnston became Ireland\'s first ever goal. Captains\nCaptaincy appearances are only awarded to players who were assigned the captaincy at the start of a game. In June 2007, Nigel Worthington was named manager in the place of Lawrie Sanchez, who took over at Fulham. Neil Lennon, a Roman Catholic Celtic player who had been subject to sectarian abuse from Northern Ireland fans while playing for Northern Ireland in Windsor Park, was issued a death threat by Loyalists and retired from international football in 2002 as a result. It was the international debut of 17-year-old Norman Whiteside, who became the youngest player ever in the World Cup finals, a record that still stands. They faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly Spanish crowd and a Spanish-speaking referee in Héctor Ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from the Spanish players. The Irish FA continued to organise its national team on an all-Ireland basis. This plan was given an ""in principle"" go-ahead by the Irish Football Association.

Since its inception, the Irish Cup has always been, and continues to be, considered the most important such competition in Northern Ireland (and, prior to 1921, Ireland), second only to the NIFL Premiership. All six counties in Northern Ireland have been represented in the final. Prior to the break-away from the Irish Football Association by clubs from what would become the Irish Free State in 1921, the Irish Cup was the national cup competition for the whole of Ireland. The cup final is the climax of the domestic season in Northern Ireland and usually attracts the biggest attendance of any club match. The winners qualify to represent Northern Ireland in the following season's UEFA Europa Conference League, subject to the club attaining a UEFA licence. History\nThe Irish Cup was inaugurated in the 1880–81 season, with seven clubs taking part. Shelbourne, Bohemians and Derry City are the only clubs to win both the Irish Cup and the FAI Cup. Other Dublin clubs to compete in the Irish Cup were Dublin University, St. James's Gate, Dublin Association, Tritonville and Richmond Rovers. The draw for the first round took place on 10 January 1881, with the first ever Irish Cup matches being played on 5 February 1881. Final venues\nThere have been 141 Irish Cup finals contested during the 144 competitions completed thus far, as the final was not played on three occasions. The 8 fourth qualifying round winners then join the 24 senior clubs from levels 1 and 2 of the Northern Ireland Football League in the first round of the main competition, which consists of 32 clubs and is played in January.

The reason for this was because up until that point, the Tang rulers had all been male members of the Li family. While her organization of the civil service system was criticized for its laxity of the promotion of officials, Wu was still considered capable of evaluating the officials\' performance once they were in office. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together.

Minute Maid Park, rebranding to Daikin Park on January 1, 2025, (originally Enron Field and formerly Astros Field) is a retractable roof stadium in Houston, Texas, United States. Upon an agreement among all of the leadership entities, the idea of a retractable roof stadium was confirmed for the new ballpark. This would result in center field dimensions of 436 feet (then the longest in MLB) being reduced to 409 feet. Additionally, a smaller HD screen was added on the far left field wall. The Red Line also serves the ballpark at Preston Station, six blocks to the west. Ty Wigginton became the third Astro to hit the left field pole on September 16, 2007.

While Montreal\'s Olympic Stadium was the first baseball park to have a retractable roof, the roof was plagued by numerous problems, and was never fully used. It had state-of-the-art amenities including a retractable roof, hotel, and a restaurant behind the outfield from where patrons could view the games. Because the roof needs to go somewhere when not covering the field, a distinguishing characteristic of the retractable roof park is a large extension of the interior spaces to either one side of the field or both sides that the roof sits on when retracted. However, the mechanism never worked correctly, and what was supposed to be a retractable roof was initially not used, then used for only a short period of time, and later replaced with a permanently fixed roof, making the stadium a strictly indoor facility. In the same year, Chase Field opened as Bank One Ballpark for the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, it incorporated a retractable roof and a swimming pool—elements that did not exist in jewel-box ballparks. While most stadiums seal up when the roof is closed, others remain partially open, such as T-Mobile Park, whose roof acts as an ""umbrella"" to shield from Seattle\'s frequently rainy weather.

By January 2002, Henry\'s stadium proposals were effectively scrapped when MLB Commissioner Bud Selig engineered a three-franchise ownership swap—Henry left to own the Boston Red Sox, while Montreal Expos owner Jeffrey Loria took over the Marlins.

LoanDepot Park (officially stylized as loanDepot park, and named Marlins Park until 2021) is a retractable roof stadium located in Miami, Florida, United States. Loria, a notable art dealer, took the four bright primary colors off the palette of the late Catalan surrealist, Joan Miró, to conveniently label different zones around the park—green (outfield), red (third-base line), yellow (first-base line) and blue (behind home plate).

AT&T Stadium, which has a retractable roof system, also includes a setting that mimics a hole in the roof as a tribute to Texas Stadium. This resulted in a partial roof that covered most of the stands but not the playing field itself. The open roof allowed snow to cover the field in the Thanksgiving Day game against the Miami Dolphins in 1993. The unusual roof also introduced a unique difficulty in televising games, as sunlight would cover part of the field and make it hard for TV cameras to adjust for the changes in light. An overhead shot of the stadium (looking down at the field from the hole in the roof) was also featured prominently as part of the show's opening credits for each of its thirteen seasons on CBS. The Cowboys left Texas Stadium after the 2008 NFL season for Cowboys Stadium (opened for the 2009 NFL season) that was partially funded by taxpayers in Arlington. However, by the 2000s other NFL teams received new stadiums that had more club and luxury seating than Texas Stadium had, so the Dallas Cowboys asked for a new stadium. With two games left for the Cowboys to play in the 1967 season, Murchison and Cowboys general manager Tex Schramm announced a plan to build a new stadium in the northwest suburb of Irving. Roof\nThe most distinctive element of Texas Stadium was its partial roof, the only one in the NFL. Texas Stadium, along with Schaefer Stadium (1971), Arrowhead Stadium (1972), Rich Stadium (1973), and the Pontiac Silverdome (1975), was part of a new wave of football-only stadiums (all with artificial turf) built following the AFL–NFL merger. The field was surrounded by a blue wall emblazoned with white stars, a design replicated in its successor, Cowboys Stadium. Texas Stadium's field alignment (between the goal posts) was southw"", 'From Globe Life Field:\nGlobe Life Field is a retractable roof stadium in Arlington, Texas, United States. Therefore, the Rangers proposed that their new ballpark be constructed with a retractable roof. The new stadium was to be constructed in a public/private partnership and have a retractable roof.

The stadium also hosted the 2024 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. MLB allowed fans to attend games at Globe Life during the NLCS and World Series. After the Rangers left Globe Life Park, it was then to be renovated for football and soccer use and renamed Choctaw Stadium. On December 14, 2019, a section of the roof caught fire while under construction. The Rangers cited weather as the reason why attendance at Globe Life Park was lower than in other baseball stadiums in major metropolitan areas, as the area is prone to high temperatures and frequent rain, and also why the venue, despite being barely two decades old, was wearing out far more quickly than ballparks of a similar age such as Jacobs Field and Coors Field.

In the years following the founding of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946, teams only averaged around 80 points per game. The highest-scoring regular season game in regulation was between the Golden State Warriors and the Denver Nuggets on November 2, 1990. Most of the highest-scoring games happened before the 1995–96 season, when the average scoring (points per game) per team was always in the 100s. Beginning in the 1954–55 season, the NBA implemented a 24-second shot clock, the aim of which was to speed up the game and create a more entertaining experience for those in attendance.

The Swedish Succession Act was altered in 1980 to allow for female succession to the throne. About 1000 A.D., the first king known to rule both Svealand and Götaland was Olof Skötkonung, but further history for the next two centuries is obscure, with many kings whose tenures and actual influence/power remains unclear. Eriksgata was the name of the traditional journey of newly elected medieval Swedish kings through important provinces to have their election confirmed by local Things. During his 20-year reign, Adolf Frederick was little more than a figurehead, the real power being with the Riksdag of the Estates, often distracted by party strife. The actual election took place at the Stone of Mora in Uppland and participation was originally restricted to the people of that area; hence, the need of having the election confirmed by the other parts of the realm. The daughter of Gustav IV Adolph, Princess Sofia Wilhelmina (21 May 1801 – 1865) married Grand Duke Leopold of Baden, and their granddaughter Victoria of Baden married the Bernadotte king Gustaf V of Sweden. Female dynasts are titled princess (prinsessa). Sweden continued to be involved in the Thirty Years\' War during reign of Christina and that conflict was settled at the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, and the Swedish monarch received representation at the Imperial Diet due to the German conquests (Bremen-Verden and Swedish Pomerania) that were made. The Estates elected Charles X Gustav as their new King, and his short reign is best characterized by foreign wars: first a lengthy campaign within Poland and then with Denmark.

On 21 December 2007, Elizabeth surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch, and she became the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015. Prince Philip died on 9 April 2021, after 73 years of marriage, making Elizabeth the first British monarch to reign as a widow or widower since Queen Victoria. She trained as a driver and mechanic and was given the rank of honorary junior commander (female equivalent of captain at the time) five months later. Elizabeth's solicitors had taken successful action against The Sun five years earlier for breach of copyright after it published a photograph of her daughter-in-law the Duchess of York and her granddaughter Princess Beatrice. Elizabeth died aged 96 at Balmoral Castle, and was succeeded by her eldest son, Charles III.

Thomas Seymour\nHenry VIII died in 1547 and Elizabeth's half-brother, Edward VI, became king at the age of nine. For several years, she seriously negotiated to marry Philip's cousin Charles II, Archduke of Austria. Accession\nElizabeth became queen at the age of 25, and declared her intentions to her council and other peers who had come to Hatfield to swear allegiance. Henry's succession was strongly contested by the Catholic League and by Philip II, and Elizabeth feared a Spanish takeover of the channel ports. Historians of that period, such as J. E. Neale (1934) and A. L. Rowse (1950), interpreted Elizabeth's reign as a golden age of progress. In the years around 1559, a Dano-English Protestant alliance was considered, and to counter Sweden's proposal, King Frederick II proposed to Elizabeth in late 1559. By the age of 12, she was able to translate her stepmother Catherine Parr's religious work Prayers or Meditations from English into Italian, Latin, and French, which she presented to her father as a New Year's gift. The English took their delivery as a symbol of God's favour and of the nation's inviolability under a virgin queen. Mary, Queen of Scots\nElizabeth's first policy toward Scotland was to oppose the French presence there. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen, but if Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply.

Quantum mechanics is the theory of atoms and subatomic systems. The quantized theory of the atom gave way to a full-scale quantum mechanics in the 1920s. Since the 1970s, fundamental particle physics has provided insights into early universe cosmology, particularly the Big Bang theory proposed as a consequence of Einstein's general theory of relativity. This glaring discrepancy, known as the ultraviolet catastrophe, was solved by the new theory of quantum mechanics. (1989), among other contributors, using data from the Cosmic Background explorer (CoBE) and the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) satellites that refined these observations. The atomic theory of matter had been proposed again in the early 19th century by the chemist John Dalton and became one of the hypotheses of the kinetic-molecular theory of gases developed by Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell to explain the laws of thermodynamics. The Standard Model, based on the Yang–Mills theory groups the electroweak interaction theory and quantum chromodynamics into a structure denoted by the gauge group SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1). The Cooper pair was an early example of quasiparticles. Also in the 1920s, the Indian scientist Satyendra Nath Bose's work on photons and quantum mechanics provided the foundation for Bose–Einstein statistics, the theory of the Bose–Einstein condensate. In time, these early engines would eventually be used in place of horses. In 1905, Einstein used the quantum theory to explain the photoelectric effect, and in 1913 the Danish physicist Niels Bohr used the same constant to explain the stability of Rutherford's atom as well as the frequencies of light emitted by hydrogen gas. Galileo's early studies at the University of Pisa were in m"", 'From Theory of everything:\nThe concept of \'atom\' proposed by Democritus was an early philosophical attempt to unify phenomena observed in nature. Prominent contributors were Gunnar Nordström, Hermann Weyl, Arthur Eddington, David Hilbert, Theodor Kaluza, Oskar Klein (see Kaluza–Klein theory), and most notably, Albert Einstein and his collaborators. Early 20th century\nIn the late 1920s, the then new quantum mechanics showed that the chemical bonds between atoms were examples of (quantum) electrical forces, justifying Dirac\'s boast that ""the underlying physical laws necessary for the mathematical theory of a large part of physics and the whole of chemistry are thus completely known"". Einstein wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, ""I have become a lonely old chap who is mainly known because he doesn\'t wear socks and who is exhibited as a curiosity on special occasions."" Use of quantum computing concepts made it possible to demonstrate that the particles are able to survive quantum fluctuations. Difficulties in creating a theory of everything often begin to appear when combining quantum mechanics with the theory of general relativity, as the equations of quantum mechanics begin to falter when the force of gravity is applied to them. Modern quantum mechanics implies that uncertainty is inescapable, and thus that Laplace\'s vision has to be amended: a theory of everything must include gravitation and quantum mechanics. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, it gradually became apparent that many common examples of forces – contact forces, elasticity, viscosity, friction, and pressure – result from electrical interactions between the smallest particles of matter. Loop quantum gravity\nCurrent research on loop quantum gravity may eventually play a fundamental role in a theory of everything, but that is not its primary aim. Even ignoring quantum mechanics, chaos theory is sufficient to guarantee that the future of any sufficiently complex mechanical or astronomical system is unpredictable. There have', 'From Quantum biology:\nEarly pioneers of quantum physics saw applications of quantum mechanics in biological problems. Though the field has only recently received an influx of attention, it has been conceptualized by physicists throughout the 20th century. Other pioneers Niels Bohr, Pascual Jordan, and Max Delbrück argued that the quantum idea of complementarity was fundamental to the life sciences. Instead, as early as 1938, scientists theorized that quantum coherence was the mechanism for excitation-energy transfer. Electron tunneling as the mechanism by which electrons transit the 2 nm thick protein shell was proposed as early as 1988. Early evidence of quantum mechanical properties exhibited by ferritin in vivo was reported in 2004, where increased magnetic ordering of ferritin structures in placental macrophages was observed using small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Moreover, quantum biology may use computations to model biological interactions in light of quantum mechanical effects. Electron tunneling associated with ferritin is a quantum biological process, and ferritin is a quantum biological agent. In 1979, Davydov published his complete textbook on quantum biology entitled ""Biology and Quantum Mechanics"" featuring quantum dynamics of proteins, cell membranes, bioenergetics, muscle contraction, and electron transport in biomolecules. In 1979, the Soviet and Ukrainian physicist Alexander Davydov published the first textbook on quantum biology entitled Biology and Quantum Mechanics. discussed applications of quantum mechanics in biology. ""Quantum Biology: An Introduction"". Pseudoscience\nAlongside the multiple strands of scientific inquiry into quantum mechanics has come unconnected pseudoscientific interest; this caused scientists to approach quantum biology cautiously. Quantum tunneling is a direct consequence of this wave-like nature of quantum entities that permits the passing-through of a potential energy barrier that would otherwise restrict the entity.

William IX was the eldest son of William VIII of Montpellier. William IX (Occitan Guilhem or Guillem) was the lord of Montpellier from 1202 until 1204. After he was exiled from Montpellier, William IX held the castle of Paulhan until his death. William's government included many features, such as a Council of Fifteen, that were new in Montpellier. In 1204, Mary married the divorced King Peter II of Aragon, who thus obtained a claim on Montpellier. He was the last lord of the Guilhem lineage. His mother, Agnes (Spanish Inés), was related to the kings of Aragon. Both Peter II's divorce case and the case of William IX's legitimacy were litigated in Rome in 1212–13. She was William VIII's second wife, married in 1187 after he left his first wife, Eudokia Komnene, who was the mother of his daughter and heiress, Mary. William IX succeeded his father in 1202 in accordance with the latter's final will and testament (dated that same year) and in contravention of the marriage treaty with Eudokia. William IX had five full brothers and two full sisters. These had been created by his father in an effort to get the townspeople to accept his chosen heir. The townspeople rebelled against William's government and drove him and the Council from the town. They invited Peter and Mary to take over the lordship.

As such, her precise placement within the Komnenoi remains uncertain, with recent scholars suggesting that she was daughter of Manuel\'s brother, the sebastokrator Isaac Komnenos, son of the Byzantine emperor John II Komnenos (r.\u20091118–1143), or of his nephew, protostrator Alexios Komnenos, son of sebastokrator Andronikos Komnenos, likewise son of Emperor John. The projected marriage aimed at thwarting the influence of Emperor Frederick I through an Aragonese and Provençal alliance with Emperor Manuel I of Constantinople.

Eudokia was sometimes described by contemporaries, including the troubadours Folquet de Marselha and Guiraut de Bornelh, as an empress (Occitan: emperairitz) and was commonly said to be a daughter of the Emperor Manuel, which has led to some confusion among modern authors about her family links.

The support the count of Toulouse gave to the rebels of 1141–43 was part of the larger rivalry between Toulouse and Aragon (Barcelona) for power in Occitania, a conflict in which the lords of Montpellier gradually built up an alliance with the Aragonese, even though their overlords, the counts of Melgueil, with whom they were related, were Toulousain partisans. (According to documents adduced at the annulment of the marriage of Marie of Montpellier, her great-granddaughter, she was the daughter of Boniface del Vasto and therefore the sister of Manfred I of Saluzzo, but this cannot be confirmed.) The coinciding interests of the merchant class and their feudal lords, whose revenues increasingly depended on taxes on commerce, sped up the process by which the lords became representative of the town. William VI or Guillem VI (died 1161) was the eldest son of William V and his wife Ermessende, daughter of Count Peter I of Melgueil. According to the Genoese account, the Ystoria captionis Almarie et Turtuose of Cafarus, the lords of Barcelona and Montpellier camped atop ""Mount Magnara"", one of two hills overlooking Tortosa, while the other foreign troops, mostly English, French and Flemish knights who had participated in the siege of Lisbon the year before, camped on the hill called ""Romelinus"". Marriage and alliance with Aragon\nWilliam VI\'s wife was named Sibylla, of Catalan origin. Power sharing\nAt the beginning of William\'s reign, secular authority in Montpellier was shared between the Guillem dynasty, the hereditary viguiers of the town, and the Bishop of Montpellier.

If necessary to break ties, batting averages could be taken beyond the .001 measurement. Pitcher Esteban Yan, who played in 472 major-league games from 1996 to 2006, mainly in the American League (where pitchers have rarely batted since the introduction of the designated hitter in 1973), also had two hits in his only two at bats, one a home run. By 1874, some teams were calculating batting averages, and by 1876, it was being calculated by all teams of the National League. Nippon Professional Baseball\nIn Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the leader in career batting average is Isao Harimoto, a member of the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame, who hit .319 in his NPB career. This inflated batting averages, with 11 players batting .400 or better, and the experiment was abandoned the following season. KBO League\nIn KBO League (KBO), the leader in career batting average is Jung-hoo Lee, who hit .340 in his KBO career. Gibson holds the record for highest major-league career batting average at .372, six points higher than Ty Cobb who has the second-highest career average at .366. All-time leaders\nMajor League Baseball\nDifferent sources of baseball records present somewhat differing lists of career batting average leaders.

Note that batting averages are rounded; entering the final day of the 1941 season, Williams was at 179-for-448, which is .39955 and would have been recorded as .400 via rounding. The record for lowest career batting average for a player with more than 2"", 'From Secondary average:\nSecondary averages have a higher variance than batting averages. Although Adam Dunn only has a career .238 batting average,\' he has a career .456 secondary average, ranking him 12th all-time. Relation to batting average\nAlthough they share a limited correlation, overall league averages for secondary average are inclined to correspond with league batting averages, which allows for a viable reference point for secondary average in comparison to batting average. Notably, during each season in a 5-year stretch in which he hit 40+ home runs, he hit more homers than doubles. For example, in 1990, Bill James identified Eric Davis as the most productive batter with a career average below .275; in spite of his low batting average, Davis had a career secondary average of .504, which was the highest of any active player at the time. Since secondary average evaluates a player\'s offensive contribution independent of batting average, it can identify players who have low batting averages yet are still productive offensively. Furthermore, batting average and secondary average are not mutually exclusive; a player can have a high batting average as well as a high secondary average. Benefits for player evaluation\nSecondary average operates under the principle that batting average is an incomplete indicator of a hitter\'s ability since batting average does not account for power, plate discipline, and speed. Ichiro Suzuki is an example of a hitter who relies on batting average for most of his offensive production. A player can possess a low batting average yet still be a valuable offensive contributor if he has a high secondary average. Batting average was not a great indicator of his true offensive value; secondary average was able to demonstrate his value more effectively. The table below shows the leaders in both batting average and secondary average for the 2013 season (bold indicates leader in both categories).

WWE recognized the match length as six seconds, though other sources reported seven seconds. After helping Total Divas win their match at WrestleMania, Brie Bella announced that she was taking an extended break from wrestling on April 6, 2016, so that she could focus on starting a family with her retired husband Daniel Bryan.
