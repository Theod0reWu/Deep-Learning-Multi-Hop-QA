Reprints and comic book adaptations\nMany reprint editions of the comic strip have appeared over the years, of varying quality. The only exceptions to this rule occur in the comic strip origin story, ""In the Beginning""; the 1996 short-story collection Cobra Trap, the final Modesty Blaise book, which contains five stories that take place where Modesty\'s age moves from 20 to 52 (approximately); and the 2003 film My Name Is Modesty, which is a prequel depicting Modesty in her late teens. This is where the story really begins, although it is treated differently in the first comic strip and the first book. 2548 and the associated story ""The Stone Age Caper"", has a villain who makes racist statements. In keeping with the ""floating timeline"" spirit of other long-running comic strip and literary characters, Modesty and Willie generally do not age over the decades, with Modesty always being depicted as being in her late 20s and Willie eight years older. Reportedly, O\'Donnell did not approve of the changes, although they were made by the artist, Romero. One immediately noticeable difference between the film and the source material is that it is a prequel to Modesty\'s established backstory as a crime boss; as such, the character of Willie Garvin is omitted. After Jim Holdaway\'s sudden death in 1970, the art of the strip was provided by Spanish artist Enrique Badía Romero. When the daily strip was discontinued, artist Romero was given permission by O\'Donnell to do a final Modesty Blaise story directly for Agent X9 magazine. O\'Donnell, to give Romero some additional work, gave the artist permission to adapt one of his short stories (""The Dark Angels"") as a comic that was published in the Scandinavian anthology magazine Agent X9 in 2002, later being reprinted in the US in a special issue of Comics Revue.

The observing site that found this asteroid is part of a large observatory known for discovering a planet. What is the difference in years between the discovery of this asteroid and the discovery of the planet?', 'From New Horizons:\nWhen the spacecraft was launched, Pluto was still classified as a planet, later to be reclassified as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto\'s moon Charon. Stamatios ""Tom"" Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory\'s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. Appointed as the project\'s principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as ""the personification of the Pluto mission"". Asteroid 132524 APL\nBecause of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter. This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph\'s capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid\'s composition as well as light and phase curves. About 30 grams (1 oz) of Clyde Tombaugh\'s ashes are aboard the spacecraft, to commemorate his discovery of Pluto in 1930. In May 2006 it was discovered that New Horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. New Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and relat', ""From 28978 Ixion:\nThe precise Lowell Observatory chords place an upper limit surface pressure of <2 microbars for any possible atmosphere of Ixion. The discovery supported suggestions that there were undiscovered large trans-Neptunian objects comparable in size to Pluto. Observers from the Lowell Observatory provided highly precise measurements of the occultation chord timing, allowing for tight constraints to Ixion's diameter and possible atmosphere. History\nDiscovery\nIxion was discovered on 22 May 2001 by a team of American astronomers at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. Since Ixion's discovery, numerous large trans-Neptunian objects, notably the dwarf planets Haumea, Eris, and Makemake, have been discovered; in particular, Eris is almost the same size as Pluto. The discovery formed part of the Deep Ecliptic Survey, a survey conducted by American astronomer Robert Millis to search for Kuiper belt objects located near the ecliptic plane using telescopes at the facilities of the National Optical Astronomy Observatory. Compared to Pluto and its moon Charon, Ixion is less than one-third the diameter of Pluto and three-fifths the diameter of Charon. A trajectory using gravity assists from Jupiter and Saturn could take under 22 years, based a launch date of 2035 or 2040, whereas a trajectory using one gravity assist from Saturn could take at least 19 years, based on a launch date of 2038 or 2040. Although Ixion's orbit is similar to that of Pluto, their orbits are oriented differently: Ixion's perihelion is below the ecliptic whereas Pluto's is above it (see right image). Alternatively, a flyby mission with a later launch date of 2040 would also take just over 10 years, using a Jupiter gravity assist. Like Pluto, Ixion's orbit is elongated and inclined to the ecliptic. At the time of discovery, Ixion was located in the constellation of Scorpius. In August 2001, a team of astronomers used the European Southern Observatory's Astrovirtel virtual observatory to automatic"", ""From Planets beyond Neptune:\nDiscovery of Pluto\nLowell's sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. Clyde Tombaugh's discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell's hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. Planet X\nIn 1894, with the help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell (a wealthy Bostonian) founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Lowell's widow, Constance, engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell's legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years. Discovery of further trans-Neptunian objects\nAfter the discovery of Pluto and Charon, no more trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) were found until 15760 Albion in 1992. Pluto loses Planet X title\nTo the observatory's disappointment and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it appeared as a point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. In 1929 the observatory's director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Naval Observatory, to measure the mass of the Pluto–Charon system directly by observing the moon's orbital motion around Pluto. Because of Lowell's predictions, astronomers thought that Pluto would be massive enough to perturb planets. Lowell's prediction had been a coincidence: If there was a Planet X, it was not Pluto. In 1925, the observatory obtained glass discs for a new 13 in (33 cm) wide-field telescope to continue the search, constructed with funds from Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Percival's brother.

It was first observed on 5 November 2012 by American astronomers Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. History\nDiscovery\n2012 VP113 was first observed on 5 November 2012 with NOAO's 4-meter Víctor M. Blanco Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory. Carnegie's 6.5-meter Magellan telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile was used to determine its orbit and surface properties. 2012 VP113 is a trans-Neptunian object of the sednoid population, located in the outermost reaches of the Solar System. The discovery was announced on 26 March 2014. The object probably measures somewhere between 300 and 1000 km in diameter, possibly large enough to be a dwarf planet. Classification and physical characteristics\n2012 VP113 is the minor planet with the farthest known perihelion (closest approach to the Sun) in the Solar System, greater than Sedna's. Though its perihelion is farther, 2012 VP113 has an aphelion only about half of Sedna's. It is the second discovered sednoid, with semi-major axis beyond 150 AU and perihelion greater than 50 AU. The similarity of the orbit of 2012 VP113 to other known extreme trans-Neptunian objects led Scott Sheppard and Chad Trujillo to suggest that an undiscovered object, Planet Nine, in the outer Solar System is shepherding these distant objects into similar type orbits. It has an absolute magnitude of 4.0, which means it may be large enough to be a dwarf planet. It is expected to be about half the size of Sedna and similar in size to Huya. Its surface is moderately red in color, resulting from chemical changes produced by the effect of radiation on frozen water, methane, and carbon dioxide. This optical color is consistent with formation in the gas-giant region and not the classical Kuiper belt, which is dominated by ultra-red colored ""]",49 years,The provided context does not give information about the difference in years between the discovery of the asteroid named after Stamatios Krimigis and the discovery of the planet Pluto.,0.17789241671562195,False,6,

The Modern Library brought out Moby-Dick in 1926, and the Lakeside Press in Chicago commissioned Rockwell Kent to design and illustrate a striking three-volume edition, which appeared in 1930. Melville began writing Moby-Dick in February 1850 and finished 18 months later, a year after he had anticipated. The first adaptation was the 1926 silent movie The Sea Beast, starring John Barrymore, in which Ahab returns to marry his fiancée after killing the whale. After three years, the first edition was still available, almost 300 copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in December 1853. Uno's The Whale God was presumably inspired by Moby-Dick as the former also focuses on vengeful whalers who seek after an unusually large and powerful whale.

Queequeg dives after him and frees his mate with his sword. The first American printing of 2,915 copies was almost the same as the first of Mardi, but the first printing of Melville's other three Harper books had been a thousand copies more. In 1917, American author Carl Van Doren became the first of this period to proselytize about Melville's value in his 1921 study, The American Novel, calling Moby-Dick a pinnacle of American Romanticism. Last-minute change of title\nAfter the sheets had been sent, Melville changed the"", 'From Herman Melville:\nJust weeks after this failure, Melville\'s first known published essay appeared. The first biographers saw a tragic withdrawal after the cold critical reception for his prose works and largely dismissed his poetry. Newton Arvin points out that only superficially the books after Mardi seem as if Melville\'s writing went back to the vein of his first two books. 1839–1844: Years at sea\nOn May 31, 1839, Gansevoort, then living in New York City, wrote that he was sure Herman could get a job on a whaler or merchant vessel. Moby-Dick eventually would be considered one of the great American novels. His warmth and financial support for the family continued after Allan\'s death. Melville had first asked her father, Lemuel Shaw, for her hand in March, but was at first turned down at the time. 1850–1851: Hawthorne and Moby-Dick\nThe earliest surviving mention of Moby-Dick is from a May 1, 1850, letter in which Melville told fellow sea author Richard Henry Dana Jr. ""I am half way in the work."" Through Shakespeare, Melville infused Moby-Dick with a power of expression he had not previously expressed. Two months after his father\'s death, Gansevoort entered the cap and fur business. The prophetic strain is expressed by Melville in Moby-Dick, most notably in Father Mapple\'s sermon. Melville dedicated his first book, Typee, to him. The chapter ""Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish"" in Moby-Dick, for instance, challenges concepts of property rights. The paleontologists who discovered the fossil were fans of Moby-Dick, and dedicated their discovery to the author. After a second visit from Melville, Hawthorne surprised him by arriving at Arrowhead with his daughter Una. After a shaky trip around Cape Horn, Melville returned to New York alone via Panama in November. Melville\'s early works were ""increasingly baroque"" in style, and with Moby-Dick Melville\'s vocabulary had grown superabundant. Nothing is known about what Melville did or where he went for several months after he finished teaching at Sikes.

Mark Hamill, the voice of the Joker in various DC projects, said that he ""loved"" Leto\'s take on the character. The Joker, based on Jack Nicholson\'s portrayal (see above), makes a cameo appearance in Space Jam: A New Legacy. Director Matt Reeves described this iteration of the Joker as deformed from an early age like Joseph Merrick, the Phantom of the Opera, and Gwynplaine from The Man Who Laughs (1928) and adept at using other people\'s horror to his advantage. In Batman: Arkham Knight (2015), the Joker manifests as a split personality within Batman and four civilians, Henry Adams, Johnny Charisma, Christina Bell, and Albert King, due to residual traces of the Joker\'s blood within their bodily systems, with Batman additionally seeing hallucinations of the Joker due to exposure to the Scarecrow\'s new fear toxin while the civilians all take on aspects of the Joker\'s personality and appearance. In 2003, American Film Institute ranked Nicholson\'s performance #45 on their list of 50 greatest film villains. The Joker appears in Zack Snyder\'s Justice League via a post-apocalyptic premonition. Despite Batman\'s best efforts, the Joker ultimately succumbs to t', 'From The Dark Knight Rises:\nHis life has taken a turn for the worse since The Dark Knight; his wife has left him and taken their children, and the mayor is planning to dismiss him from his job. Nolan confirmed the Joker would not return in the third film, and dismissed rumors that he considered using unused footage of Ledger from The Dark Knight. A deleted subplot from The Dark Knight involved Michael Jai White\'s Gambol surviving his encounter with the Joker to enable Jai White\'s character to return in a future film to try to take Gotham City over, but these plans were scrapped after Ledger\'s death and the film was edited to delete Gambol\'s subplot and have him killed off in the scene where the Joker originally simply mutilated him. Following the success of the Joker in The Dark Knight, studio executives wished for the Riddler to be included as the primary villain as he was considered a similar character and encouraged the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio. Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy\'s face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy\'s face. Nolan has stated that, due to the eight-year gap between The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises, ""he\'s an older Bruce Wayne; he\'s not in a great state."" Based on the DC Comics character Batman, it is the final installment in Nolan\'s The Dark Knight trilogy, and the sequel to The Dark Knight (2008). IGN gave it a 9 out of 10, noting similarities in tone and theme to Batman Begins over the trilogy\'s second installment, The Dark Knight, but also describing Bane as ""that bit less interesting to watch"" than Ledger\'s Joker, despite praising his ""menacing voice"" and ""body language-driven performance"".

The Nativity Façade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The stone initially used in its construction came from the Montserrat mountain, but it became clear that as quarrying there went deeper, the stone was increasingly fragile and an alternative source had to be found. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The Board of the Sagrada Família (Patronat de la Sagrada Família) and the neighborhood association AVE pel Litoral (AVE by the Coast) led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success.

The route from Koyasan, passes through Gomadanzan and Ryujin Onsen, branching off at the foot of Kasatayama, crossing the Hatenashi range along the Niu River, and joining the Kohechi at Totsukawa Onsen. It covers 6.5 km from Mikoshi-toge pass to Yunomine onsen and is a relatively leisurely walk along steep mountain ridges. The reason why the Kiiji route is not World Heritage registered is because it was repaired and widened as a prefectural road and a mountain trail. World Heritage Site registration\nIn 2004, Kumano Kodō was registered as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO as part of ""Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range"" (""Monuments and Cultural Landscapes"" under ""Cultural Heritage""). In July 2004, some of the roads of the Kumano Kodō and the shrines of the Kumano Sanzan, along with Koyasan and Yoshino and Ōmine, were registered as World Heritage sites together as the ""Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range"". As a syncretic religion, the Kumano faith carries elements of Shinto, Shugendo, mountain worship, and Buddhism, among others, and is sacred to each of these religions. Since then, ""Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range,"" including the Kumano Kodō, have also been registered as UNESCO World Heritage sites, thus continuing the exchange between the World Heritage sites of the roads [Note 3].

It can be accessed in the south from Cypress Mountain Ski Area and in the north from the Sea to Sky Highway at Porteau Road, or via many intersecting trails that start at Lions Bay.

In 2007, she played the newly launched Park Stage at the Glastonbury Festival, replacing MIA who had cancelled. Although she is a staunch supporter of the Labour Party, she was credited with helping inspire a parliamentary rebellion against former Prime Minister Gordon Brown when she wrote to all members of parliament asking them to back an amendment to an energy bill, requiring a reward scheme for home production of renewable energy. Her 2006 debut commercial single, ""Smile"" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart by July of that year and received double platinum certification by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). In the Glastonbury Festival 2022, Allen appeared during Olivia Rodrigo\'s set to perform ""Fuck You"", as a protest against the 2022 Supreme Court ruling that abortion was not protected by the Constitution of the United States. Some of the material was reprinted in the British tabloid The Sun. In May 2016, Allen announced the launch of her second record label, Bank Holiday Records. She later confirmed her support for the Labour Party and then-Prime Minister Gordon Brown in particular. Allen cancelled a scheduled appearance at the 2008 Isle of Wight Festival, telling festival promoter John Giddings the reason for the cancellation was that her album was behind schedule.

The scale of trouble now compared to then doesn\'t bear comparison – either in terms of the number of people involved or the level of organisation.

Football hooliganism, also known as soccer hooliganism, football rioting or soccer rioting, constitutes violence and other destructive behaviors perpetrated by spectators at association football events. Football hooliganism typically involves conflict between pseudo-tribes, formed to intimidate and attack supporters of other teams. Certain clubs have long-standing rivalries with other clubs and hooliganism associated with matches between them (sometimes called local derbies) can be more severe. Conflict may arise at any point, before, during or after matches and occasionally outside of game situations. Participants often select locations away from stadiums to avoid arrest by the police, but conflict can also erupt spontaneously inside the stadium or in the surrounding streets. In extreme cases, hooligans, police and bystanders have been killed, and riot police have intervened. Hooligan-led violence has been called ""aggro"" (short for ""aggression"") and ""bovver"" (the Cockney pronunciation of ""bother"", i.e. trouble).

Butler\'s interception, thanks to his quick ""read-and-react to Ricardo Lockette\'s underneath route"", has been considered one of the top clutch plays in Super Bowl history. Only six seconds remained until halftime at this point, but coach Pete Carroll decided to take a shot at the end zone rather than kick a field goal, a gamble that paid off as Wilson threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Matthews (the first NFL touchdown reception of his career) on the next play, tying the game at 14 with just two seconds showing on the clock.

Three plays later, Wilson hit tight end Luke Willson for a 12-yard completion on 3rd-and-7 and later completed a 19-yard pass to wide receiver Ricardo Lockette. The lack of a venue with a roof was also seen as an obstacle due to the NFL having never played an outdoor Super Bowl in a cold weather climate.

His narratives have an autobiographical nature of emphasis on lifestyle, relationships and ', ""From A Riot of Goldfish:\nHere is when the author's Buddhist influences become apparent. Masako is Mataichi's primary love interest. These obsessions nearly drive Mataichi to ruin; by the end of the story, Mataichi appears older than his years. Mataichi falls in love with Masako, a childhood friend. This obsession with artistry is also seen in Okamoto's The Food Demon, in which the protagonist Besshiro strives to create the perfect culinary dish. Okamoto was a Buddhist scholar, an aesthete, and a feminist, all of which influences appear in the text. When Mataichi leaves Tokyo, he feels conflicting feelings of love and resentment towards Masako. After the fight, Mataichi changes his attitude towards Masako and falls in love with her. Ending: In contrast to the beginning of the novel, which highlights Mataichi's repeated failures in goldfish breeding, Mataichi finds the one fish that he had desired to create for over ten years swimming amongst the sludge. A Riot of Goldfish (金魚撩乱, Kingyo ryōran, lit. 'A profusion of goldfish') is a short story written by Japanese author Okamoto Kanoko in 1937. Background\nOkamoto Kanoko (岡本かの子, 1889–1939) wrote A Riot of Goldfish in 1937. She was an active member of the feminist group Bluestockings (青踏社, Seitōsha). Also common in her work is water-related imagery, sensual descriptions of female beauty, the rejection of traditional female roles, an embellished prose style, and a unique use of language. The protagonist in A Riot of Goldfish, Mataichi, attempts in vain to create the perfect goldfish. Goldfish breeding is still an art practiced in Japan. Specialty goldfish mentioned in the text include the ranchū, ryūkin, and shūkin. Okamoto utilizes the natural landscape of eastern Tokyo and the Kansai region to create stunning imagery. Summary\nThe short story, set in early 20th-century Japan, follows the life of Mataichi, the adoptive son of a goldfish shop owner. The story begins in media res, with Mataichi reflecting upon his life and his obsession with Masako."", 'From British cuisine:\nA lot of myths about British food originate from this period. Writing in the 1960s about British cuisine in the 1950s, the Good Food Guide called the food of the 1950s ""intolerable"" due to a shortage of real ingredients such as butter, cream or meat. Popular dishes\nAccording to a survey by YouGov, the most popular British food is the Yorkshire pudding, which over 85% of Brits say they like, closely followed by Sunday roasts and fish and chips. Anglo-Indian cuisine\nIn the 18th and 19th centuries, the British Empire began to be influenced by India\'s elaborate food tradition with strong spices and herbs. 20th century\nDuring the World Wars of the 20th century difficulties of food supply were countered by measures such as rationing. Modern British cuisine is influenced by other cuisines and has in turn influenced the cuisines of cultures around the world. The Full English Breakfast was ranked number 1 in ""The Most Popular British Dishes (Q3 2023)"" by YouGov polls. Many vegetables seen today in British cuisine such as cabbage, peas, and cherries, were also brought as crops by the Romans. Chicken tikka masala, which comprises 15 per cent of orders in British Indian restaurants, was called ""a true British national dish"" by the Foreign Secretary Robin Cook in 2001. Food in England: A complete guide to the food that makes us who we are. A History of English Food. Internationally, British food tends to have a perception of being ""terrible"": bland, soggy, overcooked and visually unappealing. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a form of ""virtuous eclecticism"" emerged in discourse around British cuisine, arguing that British cuisine can be distinguished by its apparently unique ability to draw from other cultures. A hunger for cooking from abroad was satisfied by writers such as Elizabeth David, who from 1950 produced evocative books, starting with A Book of Mediterranean Food, stipulating ingredients which were then often impossible to find in most of Britain.

His statements were released as a 1998 interview video, Son of Hope, with a more extensive work released in book form, entitled Son of Hope: The Prison Journals of David Berkowitz (2006). David Richard Berkowitz (born Richard David Falco; June 1, 1953), also known as the Son of Sam and the .44 Caliber Killer, is an American serial killer who pled guilty to perpetrating eight shootings in New York City between July 1976 and July 1977, which resulted in six fatalities. The press had previously dubbed the killer ""the .44 Caliber Killer"" because of his weapon of choice. Berkowitz\'s adoptive mother died of breast cancer when he was 14,:\u200a18\u200a and his home life became strained in later years, particularly because he disliked his adoptive father\'s second wife. In another Seinfeld episode, ""The Frogger,"" Kramer proposes the name ""Son of Dad"" as a nickname for a serial killer called The Lopper, a reference to Berkowitz\'s nickname ""Son of Sam."" Berkowitz stays involved with prison ministry, and regularly counsels troubled inmates. Legacy\nDecades after his arrest, the name ""Son of Sam"" remains widely recognized as that of a notorious serial killer, with popular culture manifestations perpetuating this. Valenti survived her injury and said she did not recognize the killer. The killer\'s unusual attitude towards the police and the media received widespread scrutiny. From prison, Berkowitz continued to assert and expand upon his claims of demonic possession.

Monaco\nWhile Prince Louis II's sympathies were strongly pro-French, he tried to keep Monaco neutral during World War II, and he supported the Vichy France government of his old army colleague, Philippe Pétain. Under Prince Louis's secret orders, the Monaco police, often at great risk to themselves, warned in advance those people whom the Gestapo planned to arrest.

In 1493, at the age of two, Henry was appointed Constable of Dover Castle and Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. In 1502, Arthur died at the age of 15, just 20 weeks after his marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In November 1501, Henry played a considerable part in the ceremonies surrounding his brother Arthur\'s marriage to Catherine, the youngest child of King Ferdinand II of Aragon and Queen Isabella I of Castile. I took her to be no maid by reason of the closeness of her breasts and other tokens, which, when I felt them, strake me so to the heart, that I had neither will nor courage to prove the rest. He was subsequently appointed Earl Marshal of England and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at age three and was made a Knight of the Bath soon after. In 1538, as part of the negotiation of a secret treaty by Cromwell with Charles V, a series of dynastic marriages were proposed: Mary would marry a son of King John III of Portugal, Elizabeth would marry one of the sons of King Ferdinand I of Hungary and the infant Edward would marry one of Charles\'s daughters. Over 100 years later, King Charles I (ruled 1625–1649) was buried in the same vault. Despite the money from these sources, he was often on the verge of financial ruin due to personal extravagance and costly and largely unproductive wars, particularly with King Francis I of France, Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, King James V of Scotland, and the Scottish regency under the Earl of Arran and Mary of Guise. Catherine was therefore left in limbo for some time, culminating in Prince Henry\'s rejection of the marriage as soon he was able, at the age of 14. I have left her as good a maid and I found her.

Henry I (c.\u20091068 – 1 December 1135), also known as Henry Beauclerc, was King of England from 1100 to his death in 1135. As a result of their age differences and Richard\'s early death, Henry would have probably seen relatively little of his older brothers. Robert allied himself with Philip I of France. The borders between England and Scotland were still uncertain during Henry\'s reign, with Anglo-Norman influence pushing northwards through Cumbria, but his relationship with King David I of Scotland was generally good, partially due to Henry\'s marriage to his sister. He probably knew his sister Adela well, as the two were close in age. Henry\'s reserves, led by Elias I, Count of Maine, and Alan IV, Duke of Brittany, attacked the enemy\'s flanks, routing first Bellême\'s troops and then the bulk of the ducal forces. Fresh conflict broke out in 1127, when the childless Charles I, Count of Flanders, was murdered, creating a local succession crisis. The King appeared confident of regaining the remainder of Normandy from Robert, and Henry appeared ever closer to William Rufus. Henry had the support of most of the neighbouring counts around Normandy\'s borders, and King Philip of France was persuaded to remain neutral. Robert, who invaded from Normandy in 1101, disputed Henry\'s control of England; this military campaign ended in a negotiated settlement that confirmed Henry as king. Henry had no way of legally removing the Duchy from his brother, and initially Henry avoided using the title ""duke"" at all, emphasising that, as the king of England, he was only acting as the gu', ""From Oliver Cromwell:\nBattle of Naseby, 1645\nAt the critical Battle of Naseby in June 1645, the New Model Army smashed the King's major army. This style of command was decisive at both Marston Moor and Naseby. Meanwhile, Edmund Dunch being appointed as Baron Burnell of East Wittenham in April next year. He died at age 59 at Whitehall on 3 September 1658, the anniversary of his great victories at Dunbar and Worcester. The Stuart Age: England, 1603–1714, 5th edition, Longman, ISBN 113894954X. Naseby and Langport effectively ended the King's hopes of victory, and the subsequent Parliamentarian campaigns involved taking the remaining fortified Royalist positions in the west of England. The editor of the Great Rebellion article of the Encyclopædia Britannica (eleventh edition) notes that Worcester was a battle of manoeuvre compared to the early Civil War Battle of Turnham Green, which the English parliamentary armies were unable to execute at the start of the war, and he suggests that it was a prototype for the Battle of Sedan (1870). Cromwell led his wing with great success at Naseby, again routing the Royalist cavalry. The indecisive outcome of the Second Battle of Newbury in October meant that by the end of 1644 the war still showed no sign of ending. At the Battle of Langport on 10 July, Cromwell participated in the defeat of the last sizeable Royalist field army. The campaigns under Cromwell's successors Henry Ireton and Edmund Ludlow consisted mostly of long sieges of fortified cities and guerrilla warfare in the countryside, with English troops suffering from attacks by Irish toráidhe (guerilla fighters). Battle of Dunbar\nHis appeal rejected, Cromwell's veteran troops went on to invade Scotland. John Toland rewrote Edmund Ludlow's Memoirs in order to remove the Puritan elements and replace them with a Whiggish brand of republicanism, and it presents the Cromwellian Protectorate as a military tyranny.

Curonians are mentioned among other participants of the Battle of Brávellir. The death in the battle of King Harald Hardrada of Norway ended any hope of reviving Cnut\'s North Sea Empire, and it is because of this, rather than the Norman conquest, that 1066 is often taken as the end of the Viking Age. In 884, an army of Danish Vikings was defeated at the Battle of Norditi (also called the Battle of Hilgenried Bay) on the Germanic North Sea coast by a Frisian army under Archbishop Rimbert of Bremen-Hamburg, which precipitated the complete and permanent withdrawal of the Vikings from East Frisia. The end of the Viking Age is traditionally marked in England by the failed invasion attempted by the Norwegian king Harald III (Haraldr Harðráði), who was defeated by Saxon King Harold Godwinson in 1066 at the Battle of Stamford Bridge; in Ireland, the capture of Dublin by Strongbow and his Hiberno-Norman forces in 1171; and 1263 in Scotland by the defeat of King Hákon Hákonarson at the Battle of Largs by troops loyal to Alexander III. After the battle of Clontarf, the Dublin Vikings could no longer ""single-handedly threaten the power of the most powerful kings of Ireland"". On 8 January 871, Bagsecg was killed at the Battle of Ashdown along with his earls. They defeated Eogán mac Óengusa, king of the Picts, his brother Bran, and the king of the Scots of Dál Riata, Áed mac Boanta, along with many members of the Pictish aristocracy in battle. The raid marked the beginning of the ""Viking Age of Invasion"". Although Óláfr\'s army lost the battle, Christianity continued to spread, and after his death he became one of the subjects of the three miracle stories given in the Manx Chronicle. Nineteen days later, a large army containing and led by senior Normans, themselves mostly male-line descendants of Norsemen, invaded England and defeated the weakened English army at the Battle of Hastings. In all l', 'From Bagsecg:\nBattle of Ashdown\nFour days after the disaster at Reading, the West Saxons intercepted a massed force of Vikings at the Battle of Ashdown, fought somewhere in the Berkshire Downs. At one of these, the Battle of Ashdown, Bagsecg and five Viking earls were killed. Nevertheless, the various accounts suggest that there were many more Viking combatants at the Battle of Ashdown than at the Battle of Englefield, and probably more than at the Battle of Reading. Other prehistoric sites, specifically the Seven Barrows in the region of Lambourn, have been mistakenly interpreted as memorials to the earls slain at the Battle of Ashdown. In 869, the vikings claimed a pivotal victory, when Edmund, King of East Anglia was killed and the entire Kingdom of East Anglia was captured. Chronicon Æthelweardi states that Ingware died in the same year as Edmund. Likewise, other prehistoric sites in south central England, such as the Seven Barrows, have been erroneously regarded as memorials to those who fell at the Battle of Ashdown. As early as the eighteenth- and nineteenth centuries, the Uffington White Horse, dating to the Late Bronze Age, has been incorrectly considered as an Anglo-Saxon memorial to Alfred and the victory at the Battle of Ashdown. The Battle of Reading ended in defeat for the West Saxons. Certainly, Healfdene led the Vikings to a victory over the West Saxons at the Battle of Basing two weeks later, and again at the Battle of Meretun two months after that. According to Vita Alfredi, the Viking dead were dispersed ""over the whole broad expanse of Ashdown, scattered everywhere, far and wide"". One of the recorded engagements between Vikings and West Saxons was the Battle of Englefield, in which Æthelwulf, Ealdorman of Berkshire defeated a party of invaders led by several earls.

Typical sources include many groundwater sources north of the Illinois River in Illinois, United States of America. Sources of water\nGroundwater: The water emerging from some deep ground water may have fallen as rain many tens, hundreds, or thousands of years ago. Many upland sources have low pH which require adjustment. Radium Removal: Some groundwater sources contain radium, a radioactive chemical element. Additional treatment options\nWater fluoridation: in many areas fluoride is added to water with the goal of preventing tooth decay. One drawback is that chlorine from any source reacts with natural organic compounds in the water to form potentially harmful chemical by-products. To use ozone as a disinfectant, it must be created on-site and added to the water by bubble contact. Fluoride is usually added after the disinfection process. If the water is acidic (lower than 7), lime, soda ash, or sodium hydroxide can be added to raise the pH during water purification processes. Storage – Water from rivers may also be stored in bankside reservoirs for periods between a few days and many months to allow natural biological purification to take place. Chlorine dioxide can be supplied as an aqueous solution and added to water to avoid gas handling problems; chlorine dioxide gas accumulations may spontaneously detonate. When organic polymers are added to water with particulates, the high molecular weight compounds adsorb onto particle surfaces and through interparticle bridging coalesce with other particles to form floc. In the absence of a residual disinfectant in the water, chlorine or chloramine may be added throughout a distribution system to remove any potential pathogens in the distribution piping. Bank filtration\nIn bank filtration, natural sediments in a riverbank are used to provide the first stage of contaminant', ""From Tannin:\nAlternatively, a portion of the water extract is diluted with distilled water in a ratio of 1:4 and few drops of 10% ferric chloride solution is added.

Two drops of 5% FeCl3 are then added. Tannins can also be used as a mordant, and is especially useful in natural dyeing of cellulose fibers such as cotton. Ferric chloride test\nThe following describes the use of ferric chloride (FeCl3) tests for phenolics in general: Powdered plant leaves of the test plant (1.0 g) are weighed into a beaker and 10 ml of distilled water are added. In 1966, Edwin Haslam proposed a first comprehensive definition of plant polyphenols based on the earlier proposals of Bate-Smith, Swain and Theodore White, which includes specific structural characteristics common to all phenolics having a tanning property. Sometimes tannins are even added to juices and ciders to create a more astringent feel to the taste. A way to avoid this is to boil the wood in water several times, discarding the water each time. Raising the water's pH level, e.g. 1 ml of 10M HCl and 2 ml of 37% formaldehyde are added and the mixture heated under reflux for 30 min. 3 g of slightly chromated hide-powder previously dried in vacuum for 24h over CaCl2 are added and the mixture stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. Presence in water and wood\nThe leaching of highly water soluble tannins from decaying vegetation and leaves along a stream may produce what is known as a blackwater river. Many hours of boiling the driftwood may need to be followed by many weeks or months of constant soaking and many water changes before the water will stay clear. For large quantities, the most cost-effective method is hot water extraction. Water flowing out of bogs has a characteristic brown color from dissolved peat tannins.

Two years later, Anna Records was absorbed by Motown. The accomplishment is attributable to the creation of Motown, a company founded by the seventh-oldest sibling, Berry Gordy Jr. (born Berry Gordy III). By founding Motown Records, Gordy became the first African-American owner of a major recording label. Gordy retained Motown\'s music publishing division, including Jobete Music Co., and Motown\'s film and television production company, Gordy was inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame for his musical achievements the same year he sold Motown. By 1973, Motown had produced more than 100 top ten and number-one singles on various Billboard charts and had become the most successful black business company ever. Anna also co-founded a self-named music label (Anna Records) that would establish Motown\'s records nationally, such as Barrett Strong\'s ""Money (That\'s What I Want)"". Her youngest brother Robert succeeded her as the publishing company\'s head. This is considered as Gordy\'s most significant financial contribution to Detroit since 1972, when he relocated Motown Records to Los Angeles. Fuller Berry Gordy\nThe eldest Gordy child, Fuller B. Gordy (September 9, 1918 – November 9, 1991), born in Georgia, was an executive alongside his younger siblings in their brother Berry\'s Motown music company. In 1959, her brother Berry wanted to borrow $1000 from the family savings fund to start a record company. Berry Sr. (or Berry II) established a Booker T. Washington grocery store in Detroit, while Bertha co-founded the Friendship Mutual Life Insurance Company. In 1961, Gwen married The Moonglows\' Harvey Fuqua and the two presided over the labels Harvey Records and Tri-Phi Records; the latter label represented acts such as The Spinners. He was a member of the band Apollo, which released an album on Gordy Records i', ""From Jermaine Jackson:\nHowever, Jermaine decided to stay with Motown Records, citing loyalty to the company as the reason. After the group recorded three more songs with the Steeltown label (on two records) they were signed with Berry Gordy of Motown Records in 1969. When four of the brothers left Motown Records for Epic Records in 1976 (having to rename the family act The Jacksons in the process), Jermaine, who had just married Motown founder Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel, stayed at Motown. The woman, identified as Rita Barrett, also alleged Motown Records owner Berry Gordy assisted in covering up the abuse. His first marriage was to Motown founder Berry Gordy's daughter, Hazel Gordy (born August 24, 1954), which lasted from December 15, 1973 until 1988. In 1983, Gordy asked the group to perform at the Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever television special. Not feeling that they were being paid fair royalties by Motown Records for their success as well as their desire for creative control, the Jackson 5 decided to leave the label and sign with Epic Records in 1975. Others argue that Jermaine's marriage to Motown founder Berry Gordy's daughter Hazel, whom he married in 1973, was a deciding factor. Their large family and limited means made them refocus, with Katherine becoming a housewife, and Joe a steel mill worker at nearby Inland Steel Company in East Chicago, Indiana, where they lived before moving to Gary in 1950. When the Jackson 5 left Motown in 1975, Jermaine left the group and stayed at the label until 1983, when he finally rejoined his brothers for the Motown 25 television special, and their album Victory the following year. Jermaine also composed and produced for other artists, such as Switch and he produced and sang duets on Whitney Houston's debut album for Arista Records.

Rather than hosting the series themselves, they recorded auditions for a host that were uploaded as a part of their ""Ian is Bored"" series, and let their fans vote on who they should pick.

This insight gave impetus to the new fields of epidemiology and biomedicine, and most immediately allowed the resumption and completion of work on the Panama Canal (1904–1914) by the United States. Reed followed work started by Finlay and directed by George Miller Sternberg, who has been called the ""first U.S. bacteriologist"".

Adding to the controversy was that the award for Best Animated Short Film (the nominees for which were mostly made up of shorts not aimed at children) was one of the eight categories that were not presented during the live broadcast. In recent years, this has been replaced by each acting award being introduced by five previous winners, each of whom introduces one of the nominated performances. Remarks about animated films as children's genre\nAt the 94th Academy Awards in 2022, the award for the Best Animated Feature was presented by three actresses who portrayed Disney princess characters in live-action remakes of their respective animated films: Lily James (Cinderella), Naomi Scott (Aladdin), and Halle Bailey (The Little Mermaid). This criticism is based on the statistics from every Academy Awards since 1929, which show that only 6.4% of Academy Award nominees have been non-white and since 1991, 11.2% of nominees have been non-white, with the rate of winners being even more polarizing. For the first Awards, winners were recognized for multiple films during the qualifying period; Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred , and Janet Gaynor won the first Best Actress award for performances in three films. As a result, in 1941 the Academy started using a sealed envelope to reveal the names of the winners.

The first of these are the ""long slide"" models, which were too long for certain IPSC classes, necessitating the creation of the intermediate ""competition"" models. The other two form factors use the full-size ""standard"" frame with longer slides that include a lower section to fill in the space between the frame\'s dust cover and the front of the slide. With the medium backstrap installed, the grip size is identical to the third-generation pistols. The round was also still operable in the smaller frame size used for Glock 9mm models. The basic grip size of the fourth-generation Glock pistols is slightly smaller compared to the previous design. The reduced size and mass of the Glock 42 allowed for the return to the Glock-standard locked-breech design. It was designed to offer ballistic performance comparable with the .45 ACP in the frame size of the Glock 17. Glock\'s entry featured an optional ambidextrous magazine release and MIL-STD-1913 rail along with a reduction in the size of the backstrap. The weapon, marked Glock 49, appeared to be a Glock 47 with a shorter Glock 19 size grip and magazine. The pistol uses a modified slide, frame, and barrel to account for the differences in size and power of the .40 S&W cartridge. The concern with the size of the Glock 20/21 has been addressed by the Glock 36, 21SF, and 30SF, all of which featured reduced-size frames. The Glock 45 frame features a Glock 17 full size grip length with a shorter Glock 19 length dust cover and is fitted with a Glock 19 slide with front slide serrations. It is similar to its predecessor, the Glock 17L, but with a slightly shorter slide and barrel, to meet the maximum size requirements for many sanctioned action pistol sporting events. The introduction of fourth-generation Glock pistols continued in July 2010 when the Glock 19 and Glock 23, the reduced size ""compact"" versions of the Glock 17 and Glock 22, became available for retail. Whil', ""From 9×23mm Winchester:\nWhen the 9×23mm Winchester came to market with its much-increased pressure ceiling, produced by thickening the web section of the cartridge case, it was no longer needed. In comparison to the long-established .38 Super Auto, also a 9×23mm, the new cartridge was rimless rather than semi-rimmed. In comparison to the popular 9×19mm Parabellum, Winchester had lengthened the overall case by 4 mm and made it much stronger. The fact that it is not a bottlenecked case means that the brass is worked less as it is swaged back to size in the reloading process than cases like the .357 SIG where the shoulder is moved slightly with each fire and reload cycle. The IPSC Power Factor (PF) is equal to bullet weight in grains times muzzle velocity divided by 1,000. A PF of at least 175 was needed to qualify as Major within the Power Factor designation used within IPSC competitions. Many were blowing up, causing the IPSC to reduce the power factor boundary to one that could be reached with those cartridges in safety.

The 7-year delay in production caused by the court case effectively killed the cartridge because the IPSC had changed the power factor boundary from 175 to 165 before Winchester started production. Announced to the public in early 1996 at an NRA convention, the 9×23mm Winchester cartridge was claimed to have the lowest recoiling load and still qualify for Major Power Factor designation in the IPSC. The 9×23mm Winchester is a pistol cartridge developed as a joint venture by Winchester Ammunition and Colt's Manufacturing Company. The 9×23mm Winchester has a convoluted development history, but was commercially introduced by Winchester in 1996.

For example, gun laws in Australia require firearms to be registered by serial number to the owner, who holds a firearm licence. Section 5 firearms are generally prohibited from private ownership. Section 1 most commonly includes bolt-action rifles, semi-automatic rifles in rimfire only, long-barrelled pistols, and all shotguns that do not conform to section 2 requirements. Smoothbore cartridges not loaded with slugs but instead with shot (regardless of its size) can be owned without registration if the number possessed is inferior to one thousand.

By Philips acquiring PLI in 2007, another Hungarian Philips factory emerged in Tamási, producing lamps under the name of Philips IPSC Tamási, later Philips Lighting.

Philips owns the naming rights to the Philips Championship, the premier basketball league in Australia, traditionally known as the National Basketball League. Philips abandoned the Sylvania trademark, which is now owned by Havells Sylvania, except in Australia, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Puerto Rico and the rest of the US, where it is owned by Osram. Engineers at the company\'s research lab carried out a systematic comparison of various power sources and determined that the almost forgotten Stirling engine would be most suitable, citing its quiet operation (both audibly and in terms of radio interference) and ability to run on a variety of heat sources (common lamp oil – ""cheap and available everywhere"" – was favored).

The handling of ammunition is expressly prohibited within the safety area, including any dummy rounds. Some shooting ranges are operated by military or law enforcement agencies, though the majority of ranges are privately owned by civilians and sporting clubs and cater mostly to recreational shooters. Of note is the US Military concept of a Small Arms Range Safety Area (SARSA). Air\nLead and other pollutants are regulated by ventilation in a range. Lighting in the range consists of control booth, uprange area, shooting booth, and downrange lighting systems. The Safety Area will have a designated safe direction in which shooters can point the muzzle of their firearm. The level of cleaning is determined by how often the range is used. The shooter\'s vision down range should not be obstructed by lighting behind the firing line.

She summoned senior members of Tang's Li imperial clan to Luoyang. In the subsequent years, there continued to be many politically motivated massacres of officials and Li clan members. The Wu clan princes and Princess Taiping acted first against him, accusing him of crimes, and he and Li Zhaode were executed together. Background and early life\nThe Wu family clan originated in Wenshui County, Bingzhou (an ancient name of the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi). Late reign (701–705)\nAs Wu grew older, Zhang Yizhi and Zhang Changzong became increasingly powerful, and even the princes of the Wu clan sought their favour. Also in 699, Wu, realizing that she was growing old, feared that after her death, Li Xian and the Wu clan princes would not have peace with each other. One was that the work of Laozi (whose family name was Li and to whom the Tang imperial clan traced its ancestry), Tao Te Ching, should be added to imperial university students' required reading. She made him, Li Dan, Princess Taiping, Princess Taiping's second husband Wu Youji (a nephew of hers), the Prince of Ding, and other Wu clan princes to swear an oath to each other. The official Zhang Jiafu convinced the commoner Wang Qingzhi (王慶之) to start a petition drive to make her nephew Wu Chengsi crown prince, arguing that an emperor named Wu should pass the throne to a member of the Wu clan. Wu took this opportunity to arrest Emperor Gaozong's granduncles Li Yuanjia (李元嘉) the Prince of Han, Li Lingkui (李靈夔) the Prince of Lu, and Princess Changle, as well as many other members of the Li clan, and forced them to commit suicide. Around 698, Wu Chengsi and another nephew of Wu Zetian's, Wu Sansi, the Prince of Liang, repeatedly made attempts to have officials persuade Wu Zetian to make one of them crown prince—again arguing that an emperor should pass the throne to someone of the same clan.

Lesser peasant families would work for the dominant clan as tenants or serfs. The rest of the Liang dynasty lands were under the control of members of the imperial clan. He also used government secretaries  appointed with provincial governors and members of the imperial clan to monitor them. This led to two rebellions by the imperial clan, one of which saw him slaughter the inhabitants of Guangling. He constructed Cave 9–10, the most highly decorated of the Yungang Grottoes, and had a temple constructed in 488 at Lirun, Fengyi (modern day Chengcheng), which was his birthplace according to the Booke of Wei. The grandson of the last prince of Dai Tuoba Shiyiqian, Tuoba Gui restored the fortunes of the Tuoba clan, renaming his state Wei (now known as Northern Wei) with its capital at Shengle (near modern Hohhot). The Northern and Southern dynasties (Chinese: 南北朝; pinyin: Nán běi cháo) was a period of political division in the history of China that lasted from 420 to 589, following the tumultuous era of the Sixteen Kingdoms and the Eastern Jin dynasty. It is sometimes considered as the latter part of a longer period known as the Six Dynasties (220–589). The period featured civil war and political chaos, but was also a time of flourishing arts and culture, advancement in technology, and the spread of Mahayana Buddhism and Taoism. The period saw large-scale migration of Han people to lands south of the Yangtze. The period came to an end with the unification of China proper by Emperor Wen of the Sui dynasty. During this period, the process of sinicization accelerated among the non-Han ethnicities in the north and among the indigenous peoples in the south. This process was also accompanied by the increasing popularity of Buddhism in both northern and southern China and Daoism gaining influence as well, with two essential Daoist canons ', 'From List of Wu-Tang Clan affiliates:\nJoJo Pellegrino\nA Staten Island native formerly signed to Violator records.

However, the \'voting\' system was effectively meaningless, as any individual was permitted to make an unlimited number of votes, the winning contestant thus being merely the one with the most persistent supporters. Immediately after the second series of Pop Idol, the same set was used to host World Idol, in which winners of various Idol series around the world, including original Pop Idol winner Will Young, American Idol winner Kelly Clarkson and Australian Idol winner Guy Sebastian, competed in a one-off competition, complete with a large judging panel featuring one judge from each country (Simon Cowell officially representing American Idol, with Pete Waterman the ""official"" UK judge). A World Idol international television special was held in December 2003, featuring national first series Idol contest winners competing against each other; viewers worldwide voted Norwegian Idol\'s Kurt Nilsen ""World Idol"". The show has become an international TV franchise since, spawning multiple Idol series worldwide. Cowell was strongly critical of World Idol, and it is highly unlikely to be staged again.

The show was a television special, where winners of national Idol shows will compete against each other. However, Sweden's version only displayed their former Idol winners in 2010. Other versions are also customized and last for 30 seconds without featuring their past winners. The various series have launched the careers of a number of highly successful recording artists around the world, including Idol winners Will Young of the United Kingdom, Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood, Scotty McCreery, Fantasia, Ruben Studdard, David Cook, and Phillip Phillips of the United States, Kurt Nilsen of Norway, Ryan Malcolm and Kalan Porter of Canada, Loreen of Sweden, Guy Sebastian of Australia, and Elvis Blue of South Africa. The show combines a number of elements previously used by other shows such as Popstars – mass auditioning, the search of a new star, and the use of a judging panel that critiques the audtioners' performance and selects the contestants. On this basic template, the American and Canadian versions are customized, with past Idol winners appearing on the screens in the American version, while the Canadian version's screens feature Canadian landmarks.

The electrification of the park\'s retractable roof was developed by VAHLE, Inc.\nGroundbreaking for Enron Field was on October 30, 1997. Minute Maid Park, rebranding to Daikin Park on January 1, 2025, (originally Enron Field and formerly Astros Field) is a retractable roof stadium in Houston, Texas, United States. Upon an agreement among all of the leadership entities, the idea of a retractable roof stadium was confirmed for the new ballpark. This would result in center field dimensions of 436 feet (then the longest in MLB) being reduced to 409 feet. Additionally, a smaller HD screen was added on the far left field wall. The Red Line also serves the ballpark at Preston Station, six blocks to the west. Ty Wigginton became the third Astro to hit the left field pole on September 16, 2007. Carlos Lee hit the left field pole on July 28, 2010, giving the Astros an 8–1 win against the Cubs. Two days later, Jeff Keppinger hit the left field pole to help the Astros win, 5–0, against the Brewers. They are located in left field and span sections 100 through 104 (with all but the latter in fair territory). They were the most modern stadiums in the world, and now they\'re saying they\'re all bad. Hunter Pence is the first and second Astros player to ever hit the left field ""Fowl Pole"" when he did it twice in the 2007 season. Quickly wanting to distance themselves from Enron, Astros ownership asked to prematurely end naming rights, but Enron refused. While Crosley Field\'s infamous left field terrace, which was half as steep (only 15°) as Tal\'s Hill (30°), was a natural feature of the site on which the park was located, Tal\'s Hill was purely decorative. Street parki', 'From LoanDepot Park:\nThe building is the sixth MLB stadium to have a retractable roof. Retractable roof and outfield glass panels: The retractable roof consists of 8,300 tons of steel. A nightclub featuring loud music and a swimming pool just beyond the left field fence brings a touch of South Beach into the park. Problems with grass and retractable roof\nSince sod was first laid down in early February 2012, the grass has had difficulty growing under the frequently-closed roof. During the first months of games played at the new park, at least four leaks showed themselves in the retractable roof. Column illumination: Daniel Arsham and Snarkitecture were also selected for the lighting of the four super columns which support the retractable roof. By January 2002, Henry\'s stadium proposals were effectively scrapped when MLB Commissioner Bud Selig engineered a three-franchise ownership swap—Henry left to own the Boston Red Sox, while Montreal Expos owner Jeffrey Loria took over the Marlins. Henry\'s vision included a retractable roof, believed by this time to be essential due to South Florida\'s climate and baseball\'s summertime schedule. LoanDepot Park pays tribute to the two football stadiums closely associated with the team\'s stadium history. LoanDepot Park (officially stylized as loanDepot park, and named Marlins Park until 2021) is a retractable roof stadium located in Miami, Florida, United States. Loria, a notable art dealer, took the four bright primary colors off the palette of the late Catalan surrealist, Joan Miró, to conveniently label different zones around the park—green (outfield), red (third-base line), yellow (first-base line) and blue (behind home plate). The most difficult aspect of achieving gold, though—and one the design team had doubt it would be able to accomplish—was concerning the energy required to operate the retractable roof. The stadium would also not be symmetrical like the ""cookie-cutter"" stadiums of the pre-Camden, modern era. Home run sculpture: Red Grooms desi', ""From Choctaw Stadium:\nOfficials said the storm damaged windscreens in left field and caused damage to a small portion of the left field roof. When the Arlington ballpark was built in the early 1990s, the only Major League Baseball stadium with a retractable roof was Toronto's SkyDome (now Rogers Centre), which opened in 1989. (Also, Montreal's Olympic Stadium was still in use as a ballpark at the time; in 1987, a retractable roof was installed which never worked correctly and was rarely if ever retracted.) The new air conditioned stadium was slated to feature a retractable roof, which many argued could increase stadium revenue from those who would otherwise not want to sit in the heat during games as the season progresses throughout the hot Texas summer, in particular those that occur in the afternoon. Dimensions\n\nLack of retractable roof\nDespite being hailed as a wonderful venue in its infant years, articles in The Dallas Morning News began to suggest that the ballpark would have been better served by having a dome or retractable roof – much like Minute Maid Park, the home of the Houston Astros – due to the often oppressive heat that settles over Texas in summer during baseball season, with temperatures on the field being in excess of 110 °F (43 °C). The ballpark hosted the 1995 MLB All-Star Game. Notable events\nMLB\nThe Ballpark In Arlington was the site of one perfect game. The view from the grandstand reserved sections in left is particularly obstructed. The first MLB regular-season interleague game was played there on June 12, 1997, when the Rangers played the San Francisco Giants. Further, the Chick-fil-A signage on the foul pole in left field was damaged. Also, the design of the upper deck left it one of the highest in baseball. A four-story office building encloses center field with a white steel multilevel facade similar to the facade on the roof. The out-of-town scoreboard on the left field wall (which had been replaced prior to the 2009 season) also was updated with HD technolo"", ""From Rogers Centre:\n2022–2023\nThe first phase of the renovations was designed by Populous and involved re-orienting outfield seats to face home plate, raising bullpens, adjusting the outfield dimensions to be asymmetrical, adding social spaces with bars in the outfield sections of the 500 Level (the highest level), and removing some seats to widen all remaining seats, thereby reducing capacity to 41,500 attendees. Stadium features\nThe venue was the first major team sports stadium in North America with a functional, fully retractable roof (Montreal's Olympic Stadium also had a retractable roof, but due to operational issues, it was replaced with a permanent fixed roof). When the retractable roof is open, people standing on the observation deck of the nearby CN Tower can look down on the field. 2001 – April 12 – A scheduled Blue Jays' game against the Kansas City Royals is cancelled due to the retractable roof jamming during a test run, damaging the roof and sending debris crashing to the field below. The venue is noted for being the first stadium to have a fully retractable motorized roof, as well as for the 348-room hotel attached to it with 70 rooms overlooking the field. Rogers Centre (originally SkyDome) is a retractable roof stadium in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada, situated at the base of the CN Tower near the northern shore of Lake Ontario. 2018 – April 16 – A scheduled Blue Jays' game against the Kansas City Royals is cancelled due to the retractable roof having a hole as a result of the mid-April 2018 ice storm. 2001 – August 3 – The retractable roof is ordered closed in the third inning of a Toronto Blue Jays' game against the Baltimore Orioles at the request of home plate umpire Tim Welke, as a swarm of thousands of aphids descends on SkyDome. 2022 – July - The Blue Jays unveil Phase 1 of Rogers Centre renovations, focusing on outfield improvements.

If there was a street beyond left field, the distance to the left field fence would be shorter, and if the distance was too short, the fence would be higher. Rogers Centre, which has a retractable roof and Tropicana Field, which has a fixed roof, can also be considered modern ballparks. Because the roof needs to go somewhere when not covering the field, a distinguishing characteristic of the retractable roof park is a large extension of the interior spaces to either one side of the field or both sides that the roof sits on when retracted. †Actual distance to center field is 400 feet (122 m); the 395 feet (120 m) markings are to the left and right of dead center. While Montreal's Olympic Stadium was the first baseball park to have a retractable roof, the roof was plagued by numerous problems, and was never fully used. These are the foul lines or base lines, usually differentiated by referring to them as the first base line, or the third base line. In the same year, Chase Field opened as Bank One Ballpark for the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, it incorporated a retractable roof and a swimming pool—elements that did not exist in jewel-box ballparks. It had state-of-the-art amenities including a retractable roof, hotel, and a restaurant behind the outfield from where patrons could view the games.

Despite the absence of MLB history in the Phoenix area and an overwhelming roof design, much of the interior was still built with all of the hallmarks of retro, similar to Progressive Field.

The offensive line included future Hall of Fame members Jim Langer and Larry Little, and Pro Bowler Bob Kuechenberg. In Super Bowl VI, however, Miami lost to the Dallas Cowboys 24–3. Additionally, Miami won the AFC East, becoming the first team in NFL history to win their division after only having one win the previous season. The only blemish in Miami's Super Bowl victory over Washington came from their placekicker, Garo Yepremian. They reached the divisional playoff against the San Diego Chargers, regarded as one of the most memorable games in NFL history, known as The Epic in Miami. They also signed veteran running back Frank Gore and offensive guard Josh Sitton, ranked fifth at his position by Pro Football Focus, to help bolster up their offensive line. Miami avenged the Seattle Seahawks 31–10 and crushed the Pittsburgh Steelers 45–28 in the playoffs to get to Super Bowl XIX.

In 1984, 37 percent of Hispanics voted for Ronald Reagan and 40 percent voted for George W. Bush in 2004. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan extended the observance to a month, designated National Hispanic Heritage Month. Rear Admiral Ronald J.

Cultural adjustment\nAs Hispanic migrants become the norm in the United States, the effects of this migration on the identity of these migrants and their kin becomes most evident in the younger generations. Reggaeton and hip hop are genres that are most popular to Hispanic youth in the United States. As one of the only two specifically designated categories of ethnicity in the United States, Hispanics and Latinos form a pan-ethnicity incorporating a diversity of inter-related cultural and linguistic heritages, the use of the Spanish and Portuguese languages being the most important of all. The 2000 presidential election was notably close, with George W. Bush winning the presidency over Al Gore.

Mulroney delivered eulogies at the funerals of both Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. The main source of this trans-border pollution results from coal-fired power stations, most of them located in the Midwestern United States. John Ibbitson of The Globe and Mail stated in 2012 that Canadians generally supported Democratic presidents over Republican presidents, citing how President Richard Nixon was ""never liked"" in Canada and that Canadians generally did not approve of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney\'s friendship with President Ronald Reagan. relationships, which had been strained in the years prior during the Presidency of Donald Trump. Historian J. M. Bumsted says, ""In its most extreme form, Canadian suspicion of the United States has led to outbreaks of overt anti-Americanism, usually spilling over against American residents in Canada."" Military and security\nThe Canadian military, like forces of other NATO countries, fought in cooperation with the United States in most major conflicts since World War II, including the Korean War, the Gulf War, the Kosovo War, and most recently the war in Afghanistan. This relationship resulted in negotiations for the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement, and the U.S.–Canada Air Quality Agreement to reduce acid-rain-causing emissions, both major policy goals of Mulroney, that would be finalized under the presidency of George H. W. Bush. In the end, America won its independence and the Treaty of Paris compelled Britain to cede parts of southwestern Canada to them. Between 1851 and 1951, 7.1 million people arrived in Canada (mostly from Continental Europe), and 6.6 million left Canada, most of them to the U.S. After 1850, the pace of industrialization and urbanization was much faster in the United States, drawing a wide range of immigrants from the North.

Following the season, the Houston Cougars team met with President Ronald Reagan. Olajuwon, with one year of eligibility remaining, declared for the NBA draft shortly after the loss in the title game. The teams were coached by Guy Lewis and featured future Hall of Fame and NBA Top 50 players Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. 30 for 30\nThe Phi Slama Jama era at Houston was a focal point for an ESPN 30 for 30 documentary of the same name. Notable team members\nThe team members during the Phi Slama Jama era are listed below, along with the nicknames for which some came to be known. Directed by Chip Rives, the film premiered on October 18, 2016, and featured several former members of the Houston basketball team from the Phi Slama Jama era. The departures of Olajuwon and Young after the 1984 NCAA Final, in addition to the loss of Drexler and Larry Micheaux the previous year, brought the Phi Slama Jama era at Houston to a close. Included in the film were Clyde Drexler and Hakeem Olajuwon, who would go on to Hall of Fame careers in the NBA and win a championship together on the Houston Rockets in 1995; role players David Rose, Reid Gettys, Cadillac Anderson, and original Phi Slama Jama team captains Lynden Rose and Eric Davis. Phi Slama Jama was a name given to the men\'s college basketball teams of the Houston Cougars from 1981 to 1984. Coined by former Houston Post sportswriter Thomas Bonk, the nickname was quickly adopted by the players and even appeared on team warmup suits by the middle of the 1982–83 season. ""Texas\' Tallest Fraternity"" was especially known for its slam dunking and explosive, fast-breaking style of play. The teams advanced to 3 consecutive NCAA Final Fours, 1982, 1983, and 1984.

The Knicks appeared in the NBA Finals twice (1994 and 1999) during his tenure. The Magic reached the 2009 NBA Finals, where they lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. College career\nAs a senior in high school, Ewing signed a letter of intent to play for coach John Thompson at Georgetown University. Later in the playoffs, Ewing saw Magic captain Dwight Howard set a new NBA Finals record for most blocked shots in a single Finals game, with nine in Game 4, surpassing the previous record of eight by Ewing himself in Game 5 of the 1994 Finals. This  marked Georgetown's first NCAA tournament appearance since the 2014–15 season, breaking their longest NCAA drought in the modern era. He was a main contributor to the Knicks' run to the 1994 NBA Finals, in which the Knicks—in the Finals for the first time since 1973—lost in the final seconds of Games 6 and 7 to Hakeem Olajuwon's Houston Rockets. The team looked like it was going to advance to the NBA Finals when they took a 2–0 lead over Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls. He also set an NBA Finals record for most blocked shots in a single game, with 8 (surpassed by Dwight Howard in 2009). He was one of the first freshmen to not only start for but lead a major college basketball team, something unheard of back in his era. With only a few years of playing experience, Ewing developed into one of the best high school players in the country, and among the most intimidating forces ever seen at the level given his size and athleticism. The Knicks, with Ewing leading them, had to survive a grueling trek through the playoffs simply to reach the Finals. The Knicks could not, however, complete their Cinderella run, as they lost in the Finals to the San Antonio Spurs, 4–1. In the Finals, the Knicks stole Game 2 in Houston, but could not hold court at home, dropping Game 3 at the Garden.

Eriksgata was the name of the traditional journey of newly elected medieval Swedish kings through important provinces to have their election confirmed by local Things. The daughter of Gustav IV Adolph, Princess Sofia Wilhelmina (21 May 1801 – 1865) married Grand Duke Leopold of Baden, and their granddaughter Victoria of Baden married the Bernadotte king Gustaf V of Sweden. Female dynasts are titled princess (prinsessa). The actual election took place at the Stone of Mora in Uppland and participation was originally restricted to the people of that area; hence, the need of having the election confirmed by the other parts of the realm. His short reign was one of uninterrupted warfare. At the death of King Gustav I in 1560, he was succeeded by his oldest son Eric XIV. History\nPre-16th century\nScandinavian peoples have had kings since prehistoric times. Since 1980, they have been conferred to all royal heirs, male and female. The Swedish Succession Act was altered in 1980 to allow for female succession to the throne. On the second occasion during the December Crisis of 1768, under the guidance of his eldest son, Gustav, he succeeded in overthrowing the ""Cap"" (Swedish: Mössorna) senate, but was unable to make any use of his victory. Sweden continued to be involved in the Thirty Years\' War during reign of Christina and that conflict was settled at the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, and the Swedish monarch received representation at the Imperial Diet due to the German conquests (Bremen-Verden and Swedish Pomerania) that were made. In 1397, after the Black Death and domestic power struggles, Queen Margaret I of Denmark united Sweden (then including Finland), Denmark and Norway (then including Iceland) in the Union of Kalmar with the approval of the Swedish nobility.

On 13 June, she became the second-longest reigning monarch in history (among those whose exact dates of reign are known), with 70 years and 127 days on the throne—surpassing King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand. She became the oldest living monarch after the death of King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia on 23 January 2015. She had been queen regnant of 32 sovereign states during her lifetime and was the monarch of 15 realms at her death. On 21 December 2007, Elizabeth surpassed her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, to become the longest-lived British monarch, and she became the longest-reigning British monarch and longest-reigning queen regnant and female head of state in the world on 9 September 2015. Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as ""old age"". Prince Philip died on 9 April 2021, after 73 years of marriage, making Elizabeth the first British monarch to reign as a widow or widower since Queen Victoria. Elizabeth\'s solicitors had taken successful action against The Sun five years earlier for breach of copyright after it published a photograph of her daughter-in-law the Duchess of York and her granddaughter Princess Beatrice.

Mary died on 24 March 1953 in her sleep at the age of 85, ten weeks before her granddaughter\'s coronation. She was the first British queen consort born in Britain since Catherine Parr assumed the title in July 1543. When Mary attended the coronation of George VI, she became the first British dowager queen to do so. Two months after the end of the war, Prince John died at the age of thirteen. They played with their cousins, the children of the Prince of Wales, who were similar in age. Her status as the only unmarried British princess who was not descended from Queen Victoria made her a suitable candidate for the royal family\'s most eligible bachelor, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, her second cousin once removed and the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. In 1935, George and Mary celebrated their silver jubilee, with celebrations taking place throughout the British Empire. Although May was a great-grandchild of George III, she was only a minor member of the British royal family. From an early age, she was known to her family, friends and the public by the diminutive name of ""May"", after her birth month. Mary\'s husband ascended the throne and she became queen consort. Queen Mary\'s eldest son ascended the throne as Edward VIII. Many places and buildings have been named in Mary\'s honour, including Queen Mary University of London, Queen Mary Reservoir in Surrey, and Queen Mary College in Lahore. After receiving advice from British prime minister Stanley Baldwin, as well as the Dominion governments, that he could not remain king and marry Simpson, Edward abdicated. At the age of 24, she was betrothed to her second cousin once removed Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales and second in line to the throne.

They had 2 sons (one of which, ""Frittie"", Prince Friedrich of Hesse, was a haemophiliac and died from bleeding out after a fall out of his mother\'s bedroom window), 5 daughters (one of whom died of diphtheria) and 15 grandchildren (two of whom died at a young age). Like other British royal holders of German titles (such as Admiral Louis Battenberg), Princess Helena, Prince Christian, and their two daughters gave up their titles to Schleswig-Holstein in 1917 when the British and German Empires were at war. They had 3 sons (one of whom died within a day), 3 daughters, 7 grandsons (one stillborn) and 3 granddaughters. They had 2 sons (one stillborn), 4 daughters, 10 grandsons (8 of whom survived their first week of life) and 9 granddaughters. Queen Victoria, the British monarch from 1837 to 1901, and Prince Albert (her husband from 1840 until his death in 1861) had 9 children, 42 grandchildren, and 87 great-grandchildren. Overview\nVictoria and Albert had 22 granddaughters and 20 grandsons, of whom two (the youngest sons of Prince Alfred and Princess Helena) were stillborn, and two more (Prince Alexander John of Wales and Prince Harald of Schleswig-Holstein) died shortly after birth. Because of his support for Germany in World War I, he lost his English knighthood in the Order of the Garter in 1915 and his British royal titles, peerages and honours in 1919. Queen Victoria → Princess Beatrice → Princess Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg (Queen of Spain) → Infante Juan, Count of Barcelona → King Juan Carlos I → King Felipe VI\nDue to anti-German feeling during the First World War, the members of the Battenberg family who were British citizens relinquished their titles of Prince and Princess of Battenberg and the styles of Highness and Serene Highness', 'From Monarchy of the United Kingdom:\nThe Duchy of Cornwall is a similar estate held in trust to meet the expenses of the monarch\'s eldest son. Upon Henry\'s death, his eldest surviving legitimate son Richard succeeded to the throne; Richard was absent from England for most of his reign, for he left to fight in the Crusades. The monarch is also head of state of the Crown Dependencies and the British Overseas Territories. The title Emperor of India was added to the British monarch\'s titles between 1876 and 1948. The monarch\'s image is used to signify British sovereignty and government authority – their profile, for instance, appears on Bank of England notes and all British coins and their portrait in government buildings. The form ""Britannic Majesty"" appears in international treaties and on passports to differentiate the British monarch from foreign rulers. During the long reign of his grandson, George III, thirteen of Britain\'s American colonies were lost when they formed the United States of America after the American Revolutionary War, but British influence elsewhere in the world continued to grow. Although the Duke of York died in battle in 1460, his eldest son, Edward IV, led the Yorkists to victory in 1461, overthrowing Henry VI and Margaret of Anjou. The monarchy of the United Kingdom, commonly referred to as the British monarchy, is the form of government used by the United Kingdom by which a hereditary monarch reigns as the head of state, with their powers regulated by the British Constitution. Instead, the British monarch was acknowledged as ""Head of the Commonwealth"" in all Commonwealth member states, whether they were realms or republics. The position is purely ceremonial, and is not inherited by the British monarch as of right but is vested in an individual chosen by the Commonwealth heads of government.

The Nobel Prize in Physics (Swedish: Nobelpriset i fysik) is awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences to scientists in the various fields of physics. The Prize was not awarded in 1917, as the Nobel Committee for Physics decided that none of that year's nominations met the necessary criteria, but was awarded to Charles Glover Barkla in 1918 and counted as the 1917 prize. The first prize in physics was awarded in 1901 to Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen, of Germany, who received 150,782 SEK. William Lawrence Bragg was the youngest Nobel laureate in physics; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25.

Heisenberg was awarded the 1932 Nobel Prize in Physics ""for the creation of quantum mechanics"". Werner Karl Heisenberg (; German: [ˈvɛʁnɐ kaʁl ˈhaɪzn̩bɛʁk] ; 5 December 1901 – 1 February 1976) was a German theoretical physicist, one of the main pioneers of the theory of quantum mechanics, and a principal scientist in the Nazi nuclear weapons program during World War II. ""Development of concepts in the history of quantum theory"". Einstein continued to maintain that quantum physics must be incomplete because it implies that the universe is indeterminate at a fundamental level. Philosophy and worldview\nHeisenberg admired Eastern philosophy and saw parallels between it and quantum mechanics, describing himself as in ""complete agreement"" with the book The Tao of Physics.

Molecular orbital theory\nAn alternative approach to valence bond theory was developed in 1929 by Friedrich Hund and Robert S. Mulliken, in which electrons are described by mathematical functions delocalized over an entire molecule. Quantum Mechanics:Non-relativistic Theory. Atoms in Molecules: A Quantum Theory. Pioneering applications of this in chemistry were performed by Rice and Ramsperger in 1927 and Kassel in 1928, and generalized into the RRKM theory in 1952 by Marcus who took the transition state theory developed by Eyring in 1935 into account. Density functional theory\nThe Thomas–Fermi model was developed independently by Thomas and Fermi in 1927. Many chemists were introduced to the field of quantum chemistry by Pauling's 1939 text The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals: An Introduction to Modern Structural Chemistry, wherein he summarized this work (referred to widely now as valence bond theory) and explained quantum mechanics in a way which could be followed by chemists.

He advocates that the two primary approaches to quantum gravity, loop quantum gravity and string theory, can be reconciled as different aspects of the same underlying theory. Smolin does not believe that quantum mechanics is a ""final theory"":\n\nI am convinced that quantum mechanics is not a final theory. Among Smolin\'s contributions are the co-invention of doubly special relativity (with João Magueijo, independently of work by Giovanni Amelino-Camelia), and of relative locality (with Amelino-Camelia, Laurent Freidel, and Jerzy Kowalski-Glikman). In his earlier book Three Roads to Quantum Gravity (2002), Smolin stated that loop quantum gravity and string theory were essentially the same concept seen from different perspectives. Theories and work\nLoop quantum gravity\nSmolin contributed to the theory of loop quantum gravity (LQG) in collaborative work with Ted Jacobson, Carlo Rovelli, Louis Crane, Abhay Ashtekar and others. Contributions to the philosophy of physics\nSmolin has contributed to the philosophy of physics through a series of papers and books that advocate the relational, or Leibnizian, view of space and time. His research interests also include cosmology, elementary particle theory, the foundations of quantum mechanics, and theoretical biology. In recent years, he has pioneered two new approaches to the interpretation of quantum mechanics suggested by his work on the reality of time, called the real ensemble interpretation and the principle of precedence.

His reign also saw the launch of the First Crusade to regain the Holy Land, which heavily involved his family although he personally did not support the expedition. Philip II Augustus undertook a massive French expansion in the 13th century, but most of these acquisitions were lost both by the royal system of ""apanage"" (the giving of regions to members of the royal family to be administered) and through losses in the Hundred Years\' War. Up to the 12th century, the period saw the elaboration and extension of the seigneurial economic system (including the attachment of peasants to the land through serfdom); the extension of the Feudal system of political rights and obligations between lords and vassals; the so-called ""feudal revolution"" of the 11th century during which ever smaller lords took control of local lands in many regions; and the appropriation by regional/local seigneurs of various administrative, fiscal and judicial rights for themselves. The seigneurial reaction to expanding urbanism and enfranchisement was mixed; some lords fought against the changes, but some lords gained financial and political advantages from the communal movement and growing trade. The lay lords and the ecclesiastical lords (bishops and other high clergy) who made up the Estates-General were not elected by their peers, but directly chosen and summoned by the king.

With Aragonese assistance he initiated new construction on his family\'s castle in the north of the town. The coinciding interests of the merchant class and their feudal lords, whose revenues increasingly depended on taxes on commerce, sped up the process by which the lords became representative of the town. The marriage was less an alliance between William and a minor aristocratic family from Catalonia than a tightening of ties with the House of Barcelona, soon to rule a complex of territories north and south of the Pyrenees. The support the count of Toulouse gave to the rebels of 1141–43 was part of the larger rivalry between Toulouse and Aragon (Barcelona) for power in Occitania, a conflict in which the lords of Montpellier gradually built up an alliance with the Aragonese, even though their overlords, the counts of Melgueil, with whom they were related, were Toulousain partisans. According to the Genoese account, the Ystoria captionis Almarie et Turtuose of Cafarus, the lords of Barcelona and Montpellier camped atop ""Mount Magnara"", one of two hills overlooking Tortosa, while the other foreign troops, mostly English, French and Flemish knights who had participated in the siege of Lisbon the year before, camped on the hill called ""Romelinus"". Power sharing\nAt the beginning of William\'s reign, secular authority in Montpellier was shared between the Guillem dynasty, the hereditary viguiers of the town, and the Bishop of Montpellier.

Its running time was 56 seconds longer than the previous issue which is unexplained. The Night on Bald Mountain segment was reported in 2015 as being in development by Disney Productions for a feature-length live-action film with a treatment written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. Fantasound, developed in part by Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film\'s running time in this version remains unclear in existing records. The episode aired uncut on television once again in 1966, before the edits were incorporated into the film\'s 1969 theatrical reissue and has remained on all releases since. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The final shot, beginning with a black foreground and a shining white light in the background, measured 217 feet (66 m) of film; according to Disney historian John Culhane, this was likely the longest continuous scene in animation history to date. Deems Taylor prepared introductions for The Firebird by Stravinsky, La Mer by Claude Debussy, Adventures in a Perambulator by John Alden Carpenter, Don Quixote by Richard Strauss, and Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky ""to have them for the future in case we decided to make any one of them"".

This allowed the digital stereo recording of the Kostal soundtrack to be presented for the first time, and made Fantasia the first theatrical feature film presented in digital stereo sound.

The Streak became the cornerstone of WrestleMania, with a potential win over The Undertaker at the event being described as a greater honor than winning the WWE Championship. However, during an episode of Saturday Night\'s Main Event in February 1992, The Undertaker turned face and defended Randy Savage\'s manager and wife, Miss Elizabeth, from Roberts\'s attack. This was the only disqualification victory in The Undertaker\'s streak, as all other wins were obtained by pinfall, submission, or casket. Final wins (21–0)\nIn the lead-up to WrestleMania XXVII, Triple H vowed to do what his best friend Michaels could not: end the Streak. At the time, he said he did not know if Lesnar was going to return to WWE, but he wanted to position himself for a match with him just in case and that came later than expected. Calaway credits Roberts for providing him with advice and insight in his early career, while Roberts said he knew from the very beginning Calaway would become a superstar as The Undertaker. Calaway was legitimately hospitalized afterwards with a severe concussion suffered early in the match. Calaway\'s wife, Michelle McCool, revealed in 2020 that Edge refused the opportunity to break the Streak. He added that Calaway was shocked by the decision, but willingly participated since he wanted to give back to the business. The Undertaker\nBorn Mark William Calaway on March 24, 1965, in Houston, The Undertaker is a former American professional wrestler. Although victorious, Calaway legitimately could not walk out of the arena, and had to be stretchered to the back by paramedics. The Streak was a series of 21 victories for professional wrestler The Undertaker (Mark Calaway) ', 'From Bray Wyatt:\nAfter attacking Owens, he extended his hand to Alexa Bliss, which she took and smirked as they disappeared. Narrated by Mark Calaway, the film examines both Rotunda’s career and personal life and features interviews with his family and various WWE personalities.

Another match between The Fiend and Orton was scheduled for WrestleMania 37. The Fiend ultimately defeated Cena in the end, marking Wyatt\'s first and only WrestleMania victory. Wyatt went on to accept Cena\'s challenge for a WrestleMania match, with Cena successfully resisting the urge to become a ""monster"" and overcoming interference from Harper and Rowan to defeat Wyatt at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, marking Wyatt\'s first pinfall loss on WWE\'s main roster. On the April 10 episode of SmackDown, Wyatt challenged new Universal Champion Braun Strowman, who won the title at WrestleMania. At WrestleMania 34 on April 8, Wyatt returned and turned face after he interfered in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal, helping Hardy win. At WrestleMania 32 on April 3, The Wyatt Family confronted The Rock, who defeated Rowan in an impromptu match in six seconds; the Wyatts were fended off by John Cena and The Rock. The feud continued after WrestleMania XXX based on the story that Wyatt was capturing Cena\'s fanbase, which was exemplified by Wyatt leading a children\'s choir to the ring on the April 28 episode of Raw, with the children later putting on sheep masks. However, this was revealed to be a ruse as Orton destroyed The Wyatt Family compound, including Sister Abigail\'s grave, two weeks later, and defeated Wyatt for the title at WrestleMania 33 on April 2, ending Wyatt\'s reign at 49 days.

There is no greater WWE star ever than The Undertaker"". Despite Calaway\'s perplexed, pessimistic feelings about McMahon\'s gimmick idea, he was readily accepting of the role, feeling anything better than the laughingstock gimmicks of that time, such as The Gobbledy Gooker. Other than his music being played, Calaway was not reported to have any association with the affair, though he had previously donated to Trump\'s campaign in 2020 and would later endorse him in 2024. This match also made both The Undertaker and Michaels the first men in WWE history to main event WrestleMania in three different decades (Undertaker main evented WrestleMania 13 and XXIV in 1997 and 2008 and Michaels main evented WrestleMania XII and XIV in 1996 and 1998 and XX and 23 in 2004 and 2007, respectively). This Undertaker, however, played by Brian Lee (one of Calaway\'s real-life best friends) was an impostor Undertaker (dubbed ""The Underfaker"" by fans) rejuvenated by Dibiase\'s money rather than Bearer\'s urn. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. A main attraction of the Deadman gimmick, The Undertaker mesmerized his opponents and viewers alike through elaborately ""bone-chilling"" entrances.
