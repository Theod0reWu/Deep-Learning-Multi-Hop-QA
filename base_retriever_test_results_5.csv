This discrepancy in resources available causes there to be a significant difference in the scores of students from different racial backgrounds. The difference between the student\'s expected score and actual score is presumed to be due primarily to the teacher\'s efforts. Generally, private universities charge much higher tuition than their public counterparts, which rely on state funds to make up the difference. Over the past 40 years the gap in graduation rates for wealthy students and low-income students has widened significantly. Preschool age ranges anywhere from 3 to 5 years old. Sex differences\nAccording to research over the past 20 years, girls generally outperform boys in the classroom on measures of grades across all subjects and graduation rates. As of 2023, twenty-seven states require students to pass three math courses before graduation from high school, and seventeen states and the District of Columbia require four. Education is mandatory until age 16 (18 in some states). Most children enter the public education system around the age of five or six.

In January 2009, Holbrooke was appointed as a special adviser on Pakistan and Afghanistan, working under President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Holbrooke was the Founding Chairman of the American Academy in Berlin; President and CEO of the Global Business Coalition on HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, the business alliance against HIV/AIDS, until his appointment as a special envoy by President Barack Obama; and Chairman of the Asia Society. Holbrooke\'s relationship with President Obama was minimal and his relationship was even worse with Joe Biden.

Stamatios ""Tom"" Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory\'s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. Appointed as the project\'s principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as ""the personification of the Pluto mission"". Asteroid 132524 APL\nBecause of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter. Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto\'s moon Charon. This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph\'s capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid\'s composition as well as light and phase curves. In May 2006 it was discovered that New Horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. New Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL.

Those could only be estimated, until the discovery of Pluto\'s outer moons in late 2005. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) states that Charon is a satellite of Pluto, but the idea that Charon might be classified as a dwarf planet in its own right may be considered at a later date. The International Astronomical Union formally announced Christy\'s discovery to the world on July 7, 1978. With half the diameter and one-eighth the mass of Pluto, Charon is a very large moon in comparison to its parent body. Name\nCharon was first given the temporary designation S/1978 P 1, after its discovery, following the then recently instituted convention. The discovery of Charon allowed astronomers to calculate accurately the mass of the Plutonian system, and mutual occultations revealed their sizes. Coincidentally, nearly four decades before Charon\'s discovery, science fiction author Edmond Hamilton had invented three moons of Pluto for his 1940 novel Calling Captain Future and named them Charon, Styx, and Cerberus;\nStyx and Kerberos are the two smallest Plutonian moons, and were named in 2013.

Flagstaff had also been highlighted on the map by Clyde Tombaugh's 1930 discovery of Pluto from the Lowell Observatory. Dark Sky City\nFlagstaff takes one of its nicknames from its designation as the world's first International Dark Sky City, with deliberate measures to reduce light pollution beginning in 1958 supported by the environmentally-aware population and community advocates, government and elected officials, and the assistance of observatories in the area – including the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station and Lowell Observatory. In 1930, Pluto was discovered from Flagstaff. The highest restrictions are in south and west Flagstaff (near NAU and its observatory), and at the Naval, Braeside, and Lowell Observatories. The Lowell Observatory is a National Historic Landmark. More than 100,000 people visited in both 2018 and 2019; in 2019 the observatory opened its new Giovale Open Deck Observatory, an observation plaza with a suite of six advanced telescopes. Flagstaff is also home to Arizona's first commercial solar power generating station, which was built in 1997 and provides 87 kW of electricity. Passenger rail service is provided by Amtrak at the downtown Flagstaff station, connecting on east–west routes to Los Angeles and Albuquerque via the Southwest Chief line.

The Book of Mormon (published 1830) is described as an ""alternative history"" by Richard Lyman Bushman, a biographer of Joseph Smith. For example, Martin Cruz Smith, in his first novel, posited an independent American Indian nation following the defeat of Custer in The Indians Won (1970). Smith claimed to have translated the document from golden plates, which told the story of a Jewish group who migrated from Israel to the Americas and inhabited the region from about 600 B.C. In the 2005 biography Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling, Bushman wrote that the Book of Mormon ""turned American history upside down [and] works on the premise that a history—a book—can reconstitute a nation. Characters from the worst universe, ""darkest timeline,"" would later appear in the ""prime universe"". Churchill\'s essay was one of the influences behind Ward Moore\'s alternate history novel Bring the Jubilee in which General Robert E. Lee won the Battle of Gettysburg and paved the way for the eventual victory of the Confederacy in the American Civil War (named the ""War of Southron Independence"" in this timeline). Its world diverged from our timeline when the Salem witch trials are resolved by an agreement between witches and ungifted humans.

Smith\'s 11th studio album, Banga, was released in June 2012. In 2004, Shirley Manson of Garbage spoke of Smith\'s influence on her in Rolling Stone\'s issue ""The Immortals: 100 Greatest Artists of All Time"", in which Smith was ranked 47th.

On the third day of the chase, Ahab sights Moby Dick at noon. Ahab delivers a speech on the spirit of fire, seeing the lightning as a portent of Moby Dick. Moby Dick breaches and destroys two boats. On the first day of the chase, Ahab smells the whale, climbs the mast, and sights Moby Dick. The Pequod is now heading southeast toward Moby Dick. In fact, Moby Dick is then swimming up at him. Moby Dick smites the whaleboat, tossing its men into the sea. She singles out the four vessels which have already encountered Moby Dick. A typhoon near Japan sets the stage for Ahab\'s confrontation with Moby Dick. The Rachel is seeking survivors from one of her whaleboats which had gone after Moby Dick. Moby Dick smashes into splinters the three boats that seek him, and tangles their lines. The attack on The Whale by the Spectator was reprinted in the December New York International Magazine, which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review. The book is centered on the sailor Ishmael\'s narrative of the maniacal quest of Ahab, captain of the whaling ship Pequod, for vengeance against Moby Dick, the giant white sperm whale that bit off his leg on the ship\'s previous voyage. The whale, however, appears in the text of both editions as ""Moby Dick"", without the hyphen. Ishmael explains that because of Ahab\'s absorption with Moby Dick, he sails on without the customary ""gam"", which Ishmael defines as a ""social meeting of two (or more) Whale-ships"", in which the two captains remain on one ship and the chief mates on the other. When the boats are lowered, the imagery serves to dwarf everything but Ahab\'s will in the presence of Moby Dick. Ahab will give the first man to sight Moby Dick a doubloon, a g', 'From Captain Ahab:\n""Lear and Moby Dick"". Barrymore is also Ahab in the 1930 Moby Dick. Columbia Literary History of the United States. The character of Ahab was created under the influence of Samuel Taylor Coleridge\'s lecture on Hamlet and figures in biblical and classical literature such as Shakespeare and Milton. On a previous voyage, the white whale Moby Dick bit off Ahab\'s leg, and he now wears a prosthetic leg made out of ivory. Hip-hop duo Black Star mentions the sinking of Ahab\'s ship by Moby Dick on the song ""Re:Definition"" from their 1998 album Mos Def & Talib Kweli Are Black Star. Instead of embarking on a regular whaling voyage, Ahab declares he is out for revenge and nails a doubloon to the mast, as a reward for the crewmember who first sights Moby Dick. Later that day Moby Dick, ""seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven,"" sinks the ship. In several ways Ahab and Moby Dick resemble each other:\n\nboth are described with images of royalty, divinity, and archeology. Fedallah as Echo\nA subtle connection between Ahab, Moby Dick and Fedallah is formed by the imagery of the brow and forehead. Ahab\'s story, caused by Moby Dick biting off his leg, follows the same psychological pattern of being spiritually and physically impaired. Ahab lost his leg during his most recent whaling voyage, leaving him with a grim disposition and a strong desire for revenge against Moby Dick. The line around Ahab\'s neck serves as the fatal hemp, and Moby Dick\'s final dive allows Fedallah to lead Ahab to his death. Fedallah is swept off Ahab\'s whaleboat during the final three-day chase, and Ahab later sees his corpse bound to Moby Dick with a harpoon line. In 1955, Orson Welles played Ahab in a filmed production of his play Moby Dick Rehearsed; however, this film is considered ""lost"". Ahab throws his harpoon and hits Moby Dick, but its line wraps around his neck and drags him off his boat when the whale dives, drowning him.

From 1975–76, the league transitioned to a round-robin format during the regular season, where each team played home and away matches against all other teams. In 2007–08, the league switched to the traditional format, where the team finishing first in the regular season was crowned champion, and the playoffs were abolished.

Ronald Reagan referred to ""Founding Fathers"" at both his first inauguration on January 20, 1981, and his second on January 20, 1985. Several Founding Fathers, Hamilton, Washington, Jefferson, and Madison—were reimagined in Hamilton, a 2015 musical inspired by Ron Chernow\'s 2004 biography Alexander Hamilton, with music, lyrics and book by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Angelica Schuyler Church, sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton, corresponded with many of the leading Founding Fathers, including Thomas Jeffers', 'From Political career of Cicero:\nHe had no respect for Mark Antony, who was scheming to take revenge upon Caesar\'s murderers. His death only highlighted the stability of ‘one man rule’ by the ensuing chaos and further civil wars that broke out with Caesar\'s murderers, Brutus and Cassius, and finally between his own supporters, Mark Antony and Octavian. Clodius typically drew his political support from armed mobs and political violence, and he was slain by Milo\'s gladiators on the Via Appia in 52 BC. Today, he is appreciated primarily for his humanism and philosophical and political writings. Cicero lacked the political power and any military skill or resources, to enforce his ideal. An impressive orator and successful lawyer, Cicero probably thought his political career his most important achievement. The political career of Marcus Tullius Cicero began in 76 BC with his election to the office of quaestor (he entered the Senate in 74 BC after finishing his quaestorship in Lilybaeum, 75 BC), and ended in 43 BC, when he was assassinated upon the orders of Mark Antony. Nonetheless, Sulla’s reforms strengthened the position of the equestrian class, contributing to that class’s growing political power. ""Would that he had been able to endure prosperity with greater self-control and adversity with more fortitude!"" His indecision may be attributed to his sensitive and impressionable personality; he was prone to overreaction in the face of political and private change. However, his career as a statesman was marked by inconsistencies and a tendency to shift his position in response to changes in the political climate. Caesar pardoned him and Cicero tried to adjust to the situation and maintain his political work, hoping that Caesar might revive the Republic and its institutions. The portrayal broadly adheres to the historical record, reflecting Cicero\'s political indecision and continued switching of allegiances between the various factions in Rome\'s civil war. Edited, Abridged, and with a Critical Foreword b', ""From Political career of Fidel Castro:\nThe political career of Fidel Castro saw Cuba undergo significant economic, political, and social changes. The ORI began shaping Cuba using the Soviet model, persecuting political opponents and perceived social deviants such as prostitutes and homosexuals; Castro considered the latter a bourgeois trait. Castro also maintained his devout anti-apartheid beliefs, and at the July 26 celebrations in 1991, Castro was joined onstage by the South African political activist Nelson Mandela, recently released from prison. The arrival of thousands of Mexican and Spanish tourists led to increasing numbers of Cubans turning to prostitution; officially illegal, Castro refrained from cracking down on prostitution in Cuba, fearing a political backlash. Considering Carter well-meaning and sincere, Castro freed certain political prisoners and allowed some Cuban exiles to visit relatives on the island, hoping that in turn Carter would abolish the economic embargo and stop CIA support for militant dissidents. On every trip he was eager to meet with ordinary people by visiting factories and farms, chatting and joking with them. The protests dispersed with no recorded injuries. Despite their ideological affinity with China, in the Sino-Soviet Split, Cuba allied with the wealthier Soviets, who offered economic and military aid. In February, Castro visited Algeria and Libya and spent ten days with Muammar Gaddafi before attending talks with the Marxist government of South Yemen. Castro tried improving relations with the capitalist nations. Cuba still has a good relationship with Canada. In 1974, Cuba broke off relations with Israel over the treatment of Palestinians during the Israel-Palestine conflict and their increasingly close relationship with the United States. He provided them with a budget of $13 million and permitted them to ally with the Mafia, who were aggrieved that Castro's government closed down their businesses in Cuba.

These newly named models featured hidden headlamps. While prototypes wore Renault badging, all production vehicles wore the badging of the newly created Eagle brand (though designated with AMC VINs). Struggling to compete against the all-new designs of General Motors and Ford, sales of the St. Regis were heavily supported by fleets, primarily as law enforcement vehicles. To increase compatibility with other Chrysler vehicles (and to increase reliability), the B platform shifted from Renault to Chrysler electrical components for the 1990 model year. The largest AMC-branded vehicle since the 1978 Matador, the Premier was to become a full model line, including a four-door sedan, station wagon, and two-door coupe (named the Allure). The look starts in the front of the car, with a nearly straight-across bumper—demanded by a Chrysler executive after a Congressional committee attacked him over the seeming inability of car bumpers to protect vehicles from extensive damage in low-speed collisions—and a five-segment egg-crate grille that surrounds the headlamps.

The Polara 500 model was reintroduced for the 1969 model year and positioned between the standard Polara and the top-of-the-line Monaco. This was the first Chrysler B-Body. The Polara Special was discontinued for the 1971 model year with a new sub-series, the Polara Brougham, positioned above the Polara Custom, but below the Monaco. (Starting in 1965, Dodge of Canada also offered the top-of-the-line Monaco, similar to the U.S. market Monaco). Having been eclipsed by the Monaco, Dodge discontinued the Polara after 1973.

In its various forms, the Polara name was used by Dodge until 1973, when its position in Dodge\'s line-up was replaced by the Dodge Monaco. One constant of the 1965 through 1968 models was square-edged styling that was updated each model year.

It has generally been used as the motto of English monarchs since being adopted by Edward III. Since that time, the eldest sons of all English monarchs, except for King Edward III, have borne this title. Those descended from English monarchs only through an illegitimate child would normally have no claim on the throne, but the situation was complicated when Gaunt and Swynford eventually married in 1396 (25 years after John Beaufort\'s birth).

Street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the South Bronx, and much of the graffiti, rapping, and b-boying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and one-upmanship of street gangs.

Unlike the Presidential $1 coins from before 2009, ""In God We Trust"" remains on the obverse and the vacant space on the edge lettering has been taken up by thirteen stars, symbolizing the Thirteen Colonies.

Mnangagwa soon left Tanganyika to train for ZANU\'s militant wing, the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA). Mnangagwa used his leadership of Zimbabwe\'s Anti-Corruption Commission to try to discredit G40 leaders by targeting them with highly publicized criminal investigations. As the G40 faction set its sights on Mnangagwa, the Lacoste faction, largely made up of senior party members, pushed back. ZANU–PF was largely split between two factions: Generation 40, or G40, led by Grace Mugabe, and the Lacoste faction, thought to be led by Mnangagwa. In 1965, he bombed a train near Fort Victoria (now Masvingo) and was imprisoned for ten years, after which he was released and deported to the recently independent Zambia.

History\nOn 18 February 1882, 15 months after the founding of the Irish FA, Ireland made their international debut against England, losing 13–0 in a friendly played at Bloomfield in Belfast. On 8 March 1950, however, in a 0–0 draw with Wales at the Racecourse Ground in a FIFA World Cup qualifier, the IFA fielded a team that included four players who were born in the Irish Free State. People like Stewart are the unsung heroes who have been brave enough to challenge sectarianism and who have actively created a more fun, safe and family-orientated atmosphere at international games. On 25 February 1882, Ireland played their second international, against Wales at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham, and an equaliser from Johnston became Ireland\'s first ever goal. Captains\nCaptaincy appearances are only awarded to players who were assigned the captaincy at the start of a game. In June 2007, Nigel Worthington was named manager in the place of Lawrie Sanchez, who took over at Fulham. Neil Lennon, a Roman Catholic Celtic player who had been subject to sectarian abuse from Northern Ireland fans while playing for Northern Ireland in Windsor Park, was issued a death threat by Loyalists and retired from international football in 2002 as a result. It was the international debut of 17-year-old Norman Whiteside, who became the youngest player ever in the World Cup finals, a record that still stands. They faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly Spanish crowd and a Spanish-speaking referee in Héctor Ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from the Spanish players.

Since its inception, the Irish Cup has always been, and continues to be, considered the most important such competition in Northern Ireland (and, prior to 1921, Ireland), second only to the NIFL Premiership. All six counties in Northern Ireland have been represented in the final. Prior to the break-away from the Irish Football Association by clubs from what would become the Irish Free State in 1921, the Irish Cup was the national cup competition for the whole of Ireland. The cup final is the climax of the domestic season in Northern Ireland and usually attracts the biggest attendance of any club match. The winners qualify to represent Northern Ireland in the following season's UEFA Europa Conference League, subject to the club attaining a UEFA licence. History\nThe Irish Cup was inaugurated in the 1880–81 season, with seven clubs taking part. Shelbourne, Bohemians and Derry City are the only clubs to win both the Irish Cup and the FAI Cup. Other Dublin clubs to compete in the Irish Cup were Dublin University, St. James's Gate, Dublin Association, Tritonville and Richmond Rovers. The draw for the first round took place on 10 January 1881, with the first ever Irish Cup matches being played on 5 February 1881.

Comparison of a patient iPSC derived organoid against an isogenic control is the current gold standard in the field as it permits isolation of the mutation of interest as the only variable within the experimental model. Comparison of these organoid phenotypes to diseased tissues from mice and humans suggested similarities to defects in early development. This report compared kidney organoids differentiated from patient iPSC to unrelated control iPSC and demonstrated an inability of patient kidney cells to mobilise transcription factor SIX2 from the golgi complex. Other studies have used CRISPR gene editing to correct the patient's mutation in the patient iPSC cells to create an isogenic control, which can be performed simultaneously with iPSC reprogramming. As first developed by Takahashi and Yamanaka in 2007, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) can also be reprogrammed from patient skin fibroblasts. In one such report, kidney organoids derived from iPSC of a patient with Mainzer-Saldino Syndrome due to compound heterozygous mutations in IFT140 were compared to an isogenic control organoid in which an IFT140 variant giving rise to a non-viable mRNA transcript was corrected by CRISPR.

Rogers Centre, which has a retractable roof and Tropicana Field, which has a fixed roof, can also be considered modern ballparks. However, the mechanism never worked correctly, and what was supposed to be a retractable roof was initially not used, then used for only a short period of time, and later replaced with a permanently fixed roof, making the stadium a strictly indoor facility. It had state-of-the-art amenities including a retractable roof, hotel, and a restaurant behind the outfield from where patrons could view the games. Because the roof needs to go somewhere when not covering the field, a distinguishing characteristic of the retractable roof park is a large extension of the interior spaces to either one side of the field or both sides that the roof sits on when retracted. In the same year, Chase Field opened as Bank One Ballpark for the expansion Arizona Diamondbacks, it incorporated a retractable roof and a swimming pool—elements that did not exist in jewel-box ballparks.

LoanDepot Park (officially stylized as loanDepot park, and named Marlins Park until 2021) is a retractable roof stadium located in Miami, Florida, United States. Problems with grass and retractable roof\nSince sod was first laid down in early February 2012, the grass has had difficulty growing under the frequently-closed roof. During the first months of games played at the new park, at least four leaks showed themselves in the retractable roof. Column illumination: Daniel Arsham and Snarkitecture were also selected for the lighting of the four super columns which support the retractable roof. Fans are provided with the comfort they longed for at Sun Life Stadium with a 5.27-acre (2.13 ha) retractable roof, retractable-glass wall panels that offer a panoramic view of Downtown Miami, and a huge air-conditioning system. Henry\'s vision included a retractable roof, believed by this time to be essential due to South Florida\'s climate and baseball\'s summertime schedule. The most difficult aspect of achieving gold, though—and one the design team had doubt it would be able to accomplish—was concerning the energy required to operate the retractable roof.

By this time, Einstein had progressed to his general theory of relativity, including his theory of gravitation. In his book The Scientific Edge, physicist Jayant Narlikar observed: ""SN Bose\'s work on particle statistics (c.1922), which clarified the behavior of photons (the particles of light in an enclosure) and opened the door to new ideas on statistics of Microsystems that obey the rules of quantum theory, was one of the top ten achievements of 20th century Indian science and could be considered in the Nobel Prize class.""

Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein also made important contributions to quantum mechanics.

Quantum mechanics\nEinstein\'s objections to quantum mechanics\nEinstein played a major role in developing quantum theory, beginning with his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect. During this period, Einstein tried to develop a unified field theory and to refute the accepted interpretation of quantum physics, both unsuccessfully. It is considered a centerpiece of the development of quantum information theory. His accomplishments in Berlin had included the completion of the general theory of relativity, proving the Einstein–de Haas effect, contributing to the quantum theory of radiation, and the development of Bose–Einstein statistics. Old quantum theory\nPhotons and energy quanta\nIn a 1905 paper, Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen therefore concluded that quantum theory does not provide a complete description of reality. Bell then showed that quantum physics predicts correlations that violate this inequality. 1905 – Annus Mirabilis papers\nThe Annus Mirabilis papers are four articles pertaining to the photoelectric effect (which gave rise to quantum theory), Brownian motion, the special theory of relativity, and E = mc2 that Einstein published in the Annalen der Physik scientific journal in 1905. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.

One of the longest films ever released by a Hollywood studio, Gettysburg runs 254 minutes (4 hours, 14 minutes) on VHS and DVD. At the summit of Little Round Top, Chamberlain and the 20th Maine fight off wave after wave of advancing Confederates, and begin running out of ammunition. Originally filmed as a miniseries for TNT, Gettysburg received a limited theatrical release from New Line Cinema under the direction of Ted Turner, who owned both entities. Buford sends word to I Corps commander Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds to bring up reinforcements. Longstreet then meets with the three division commanders and details the plan, beginning first with Colonel Edward Porter Alexander\'s artillery clearing the Union guns off the ridge, before deploying the men forward. At 254 minutes (4 hours and 14 minutes), it is the longest film released theatrically by a major film studio in the United States. At the same time, Longstreet\'s remaining division, under Maj. Gen. George Pickett, arrives on the field. Thousands of Civil War reenactors from across the country volunteered their time to come to Gettysburg to participate in the massive battle scenes. Gen.

Its running time was 56 seconds longer than the previous issue which is unexplained. The Night on Bald Mountain segment was reported in 2015 as being in development by Disney Productions for a feature-length live-action film with a treatment written by Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless. Fantasound, developed in part by Garity, employed two projectors running at the same time. A two-and-a-half-minute reduction in the film\'s running time in this version remains unclear in existing records. The episode aired uncut on television once again in 1966, before the edits were incorporated into the film\'s 1969 theatrical reissue and has remained on all releases since. After being completely animated, it was cut out of the final film to shorten its lengthy running time. The final shot, beginning with a black foreground and a shining white light in the background, measured 217 feet (66 m) of film; according to Disney historian John Culhane, this was likely the longest continuous scene in animation history to date.

Some examples of this stipulation of match are Shawn Michaels vs. Ric Flair at WrestleMania XXIV and Shawn Michaels vs. In a variation on the November 20, 2013 episode of NXT, two wrestlers completed a match, with the match duration being used as the marker for two other wrestlers to complete their match. Blindfold match\nIn a blindfold match, the two participants must wear a blindfold over their eyes for the entire duration of the match. The most popular types of wager are the mask of a masked wrestler or the hair of a non-masked wrestler, most commonly put against each other in mask vs. mask (in Spanish: máscara contra máscara), mask vs. hair (máscara contra cabellera), or hair vs. hair (cabellera contra cabellera) matches. Another notable version of this match was used at the WrestleMania XV as well. Celebrities (such as Muhammad Ali in the main event of WrestleMania I), managers and other wrestlers can ""guest"" as the special referee. For such examples of this match type are the Extreme Rules (2012) between Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus and Chris Benoit vs. Chris Jericho at the SummerSlam (2000) pay-per-view. A well-known example of this match is the WrestleMania VII match between Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts and Rick Martel.

During the pay-per-view broadcast, a video package aired immediately before the Hart vs. Michaels match, debuting the “Attitude” promo that included the first instance of the WWF ""scratch"" logo. However, McMahon, Michaels, and other WWF employees covertly went on to change the outcome of the match without Hart\'s knowledge. During the match, the two brawled inside and outside of the ring, with both men bleeding after hitting each other with the ring bell. The Undertaker won the match at WrestleMania and proceeded to win the first ever Inferno Match the following month at Unforgiven. Although these wrestlers could, in theory, choose to sign and appear with the WWF, they instead chose to sit out the duration of their contracts and be financially supported by AOL Time Warner rather than work for WWF for a cheaper salary. Triple H participated in the Fatal Four-Way Elimination match main event of WrestleMania 2000 with Stephanie at his corner for the WWF Championship, becoming the first heel to win the main event of WrestleMania.

Calaway would later reveal that after suffering a severe concussion in his WrestleMania match against Lesnar, he lost his confidence. For the better part of his career, the Undertaker was observed as a focal point of WWE\'s flagship annual event, WrestleMania, where he became esteemed for The Streak — a series of 21 straight victories, and headlined the event five times (13, 24, 26, 33 and 36).
