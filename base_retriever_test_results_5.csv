Todd McFarlane (; born March 16, 1961) is a Canadian comic book creator, best known for his work as the artist on The Amazing Spider-Man and as the creator, writer, and artist on the superhero horror-fantasy series Spawn, as well as being the current President and a co-founder of Image Comics. ""Tony Twist wins battle over name: Judge orders comic artist pay $15 million"". Media about McFarlane\nStan Lee interviewed McFarlane in Episode 1 of the 1991 documentary series The Comic Book Greats. The debut issue sold 1.7 million copies, which as of 2007, remains a record for an independent comic book. He would sporadically return as the interior artist for intermittent issues, and for a few years wrote it under a pseudonym to generate interest in the book by fostering the illusion that new talent was being brought into the book\'s production. He sought to play baseball professionally after graduation but suffered a serious ankle injury in his junior year during a game with arch-rivals Washington State University. His practical goal was to join his father in the printing business in Calgary, Alberta, though his dream was always to be a comic book creator. McFarlane began drawing as a hobby at an early age, and developed an interest in comics, acquiring as many as he could, and learning to draw from them. Upon its release in 1992, Spawn #1 (May 1992) sold 1.7 million copies; as of 2007, this remains a record for an independent comic book. He has been credited as the character\'s co-creator, though this has been a topic of dispute within the comic book industry (see Eddie Brock: Creation and conception). In January 2005, McFarlane announced that he was set to produce a half-hour anthology television series for Fox called Twisted Tales, based on the Bruce Jones\' comic book to which McFarlane had purchased the rights. In July 2012 the original artwork to that issue\'s cover, which features Spider-Man dispatching the Hulk, sold for a record-breaking $657,250 USD, the highest auction price ever for any piece of American comic book art. He subsequently focused on drawing, working at the comic book store to pay for the rest of his education, and living in a trailer park in Cheney, Washington with Wanda, who had moved to the area to be with him and attend EWU as well. That year marked the point when McFarlane ceased to be the regular writer and artist of Spawn. The book, released on October 2 of that year, earned McFarlane a place in the Guinness World Records, for which McFarlane was given a certificate on October 5, 2019 at the New York Comic Con, prior to his panel, ""The Road to Historic Spawn 300 and 301."" #3 (1988)\nCover art\n\nThe Amazing Spider-Man #324 (1989)\nAmazing Spider-Man: Skating on Thin Ice #1 (1993)\nConan the Barbarian #241 (1991)\nMarvel Comics Presents #32 (1988)\nMarvel Age #90 (1990)\nMarvel Tales #223–239 (1989–1990)\nNew Mutants #85–89, 93 (1990) (inks only)\nQuasar #14 (1990)\nReturn of Wolverine (2018 Marvel) #1I, 1J\nThe Olympians #1 (1991) (Epic; cover only)\nX-Factor #50 (1990) (cover only)\nX-Force #1E (2019)\n\nWriting\nSpider-Man #1–14, 16 (1990–1991)\n\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nOfficial website\nTodd McFarlane at the Comic Book DB (archived from the original)\nTodd McFarlane at IMDb\nMcFarlane, Todd (July 26, 2002). It has become as much of an institution as it is a comic. In 2006, McFarlane announced plans for Spawn/Batman with artist Greg Capullo, which McFarlane wrote and inked, and which paid tribute to Jack Kirby. This came to a head during a public debate they participated in at Philadelphia\'s Comicfest convention in October 1993, which was moderated by artist George Pérez. Greg Capullo penciled several issues as a guest artist, and became the regular penciler with #26, with McFarlane remaining as writer and inker until #70. In 2011, McFarlane was hired as an artist for the game Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, on which his duties included key frame art, storyboards and directing. At San Diego Comic-Con 2022, it was announced that McFarlane would write a new Batman/Spawn crossover, with Greg Capullo as artist, and a release date of December 2022. In 1994, McFarlane and DC Comics collaborated on an intercompany crossover, each producing a book featuring Batman and Spawn. The comic was initially written by Kirkman, penciled by Ryan Ottley, and inked by McFarlane, with Greg Capullo providing layouts.

The winner was chosen unanimously on October 5, but was initially opposed by the Socialist Left, Conservative and Progress Party members until strongly persuaded by Jagland. In Asia and the Middle East: Afghanistan, President Hamid Karzai said that Obama was the ""appropriate"" person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. Fred Greenstein, presidential historian and author and professor of politics emeritus at Princeton University, told Fox News that giving President Obama the Nobel Peace Prize is a ""premature canonization"" and an ""embarrassment to the Nobel process"". Siamak Hirai, a spokesman for Karzai, said, ""His hard work and his new vision on global relations, his will and efforts for creating friendly and good relations at global level and global peace make him the appropriate recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize"". Obama is the fourth president of the United States to have won the Nobel Peace Prize (after Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Jimmy Carter, with Carter\'s honor happening after leaving office). ""Throughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it\'s also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes,"" Obama said. An editorial in The Washington Post began, ""It\'s an odd Nobel Peace Prize that almost makes you embarrassed for the honoree"", and compared the Nobel Committee\'s statement that Obama had ""created a new climate in international politics"" to a recent satirical skit on television. I urge them to expose the hypocrisy of the 2009 Nobel Prize laureate. In 2015, Geir Lundestad, the non-voting Director of the Nobel Institute and secretary for the Nobel Committee at the time of the award, published a memoir, Secretary of Peace. Obama was the fourth U.S. president to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, after Theodore Roosevelt (1906) and Woodrow Wilson (1919)—both of whom received the award during their terms—and Jimmy Carter (2002), who received the award 21 years after leaving office. Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama,\nIndian President Pratibha Patil, and Israeli President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres sent congratulatory messages to Obama, but Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki told reporters that ""the decision was taken hastily and the award was [too] early"". The award, he said, ""must be shared with everyone who strives for justice and dignity—for the young woman who marches silently in the streets on behalf of her right to be heard even in the face of beatings and bullets; for the leader imprisoned in her own home because she refuses to abandon her commitment to democracy [referring to Aung San Suu Kyi]; for the soldier who sacrificed through tour after tour of duty on behalf of someone half a world away; and for all those men and women across the world who sacrifice their safety and their freedom and sometime their lives for the cause of peace."" Jonah Goldberg of the National Review said that ""surely someone in Iran—or maybe the Iranian protestors generally—could have benefitted more from receiving the prize"" while in CounterPunch, political journalist Alexander Cockburn said that, in historical context of other former U.S. Presidents winning the Nobel Peace Prize, the award to Obama ""represents a radical break in tradition, since he\'s only had slightly less than nine months to discharge his imperial duties"". The secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Geir Lundestad, said in 2015 that awarding the prize to Obama failed to achieve what the committee hoped it would. Several Nobel Laureates commented: Bangladeshi economist Muhammad Yunus (co-winner 2006 prize) said the committee\'s award was ""an endorsement of [Obama] and the direction he is taking"". In the United States\nObama\'s winning of the peace prize was largely unanticipated and called a ""stunning surprise"" by The New York Times, though ma', 'From 2019 Nobel Peace Prize:\nIn response to the outbreak of hostilities, the Norwegian Nobel Committee released a statement in January 2022 which called the humanitarian situation ""extremely serious""; said the lack of delivery of humanitarian aid to Tigray was ""unacceptable""; and observed that ""As Prime Minister and a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, Abiy Ahmed has a special responsibility to end the conflict and help to create peace.""

Stamatios ""Tom"" Krimigis, head of the Applied Physics Laboratory\'s space division, one of many entrants in the New Frontiers Program competition, formed the New Horizons team with Alan Stern in December 2000. Some members of the New Horizons team, including Alan Stern, disagree with the IAU definition and still describe Pluto as the ninth planet. The Naval Observatory itself is not far from the Lowell Observatory where Pluto was discovered. Appointed as the project\'s principal investigator, Stern was described by Krimigis as ""the personification of the Pluto mission"". Asteroid 132524 APL\nBecause of the need to conserve fuel for possible encounters with Kuiper belt objects subsequent to the Pluto flyby, intentional encounters with objects in the asteroid belt were not planned. The spacecraft successfully tracked the rapidly moving asteroid over June 10–12, 2006. The asteroid was estimated to be 2.5 km (1.6 mi) in diameter. Coincidentally the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station was where the photographic plates were taken for the discovery of Pluto\'s moon Charon. This was the last major planet orbit crossing before the Pluto flyby. The asteroid was imaged by Ralph (use of LORRI was not possible because of proximity to the Sun), which gave the team a chance to test Ralph\'s capabilities, and make observations of the asteroid\'s composition as well as light and phase curves. In May 2006 it was discovered that New Horizons would pass close to the tiny asteroid 132524 APL on June 13, 2006. New Horizons was originally planned as a voyage to the only unexplored planet in the Solar System. Navigation is performed at various contractor facilities, whereas the navigational positional data and related celestial reference frames are provided by the Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station through Headquarters NASA and JPL. Large ground telescopes with wide-field cameras, notably the twin 6.5-meter Magellan Telescopes in Chile, the 8.2-meter Subaru Observatory in Hawaii and the Canada–France–Hawaii Telescope were used to search for potential targets. History\nIn August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Pluto discoverer Clyde Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. ""By way of comparison, New Horizons gathered 5,000 times as much data at Pluto as Mariner did at the Red Planet."" On August 25, 2014, New Horizons crossed the orbit of Neptune, exactly 25 years after the planet was visited by the Voyager 2 probe. After a brief encounter with asteroid 132524 APL, New Horizons proceeded to Jupiter, making its closest approach on February 28, 2007, at a distance of 2.3 million kilometers (1.4 million miles). The dwarf planet Haumea was observed from afar by the New Horizons spacecraft in October 2007, January 2017, and May 2020, from distances of 49 AU, 59 AU, and 63 AU, respectively. The Jupiter flyby provided a gravity assist that increased New Horizons\' speed; the flyby also enabled a general test of New Horizons\' scientific capabilities, returning data about the planet\'s atmosphere, moons, and magnetosphere. Once sufficient orbital information was provided, the Minor Planet Center gave provisional designations to the three target KBOs: 2014 MU69 (later 486958 Arrokoth) (PT1), 2014 OS393 (PT2), and 2014 PN70 (PT3). On July 14, 2015, at 11:49 UTC, it flew 12,500 km (7,800 mi) above the surface of Pluto, which at the time was 34 AU from the Sun, making it the first spacecraft to explore the dwarf planet. However, the APL, in addition to being supported by Pluto Kuiper Express developers at the Goddard Space Flight Center and Stanford University were at an advantage; they had recently developed NEAR Shoemaker for NASA, which had successfully entered orbit around 433 Eros earlier that year, and would later land on the asteroid to scientific and engineering fanfare. New Horizons is an interplanetary space probe launched as a part of NASA\'s New Frontiers program. Engineered by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), with a team led by Alan Stern, the spacecraft was launched in 2006 with the primary mission to perform a flyby study of the Pluto system in 2015, and a secondary mission to fly by and study one or more other Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) in the decade to follow, which became a mission to 486958 Arrokoth. It is the fifth space probe to achieve the escape velocity needed to leave the Solar System. On January 19, 2006, New Horizons was launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station by an Atlas V rocket directly into an Earth-and-solar escape trajectory with a speed of about 16.26 km/s (10.10 mi/s; 58,500 km/h; 36,400 mph). It was the fastest (average speed with respect to Earth) human-made object ever launched from Earth. It is not the fastest speed recorded for a spacecraft, which, as of', 'From Eris (dwarf planet):\nSee also\nClearing the neighborhood\nList of Solar System objects most distant from the Sun\nList of trans-Neptunian objects\nMesoplanet\n\nExplanatory notes\nReferences\nExternal links\n\nMichael Brown\'s webpages about Eris and Dysnomia\nMPC Database entry for (136199) Eris\n3D orbit visualization from NASA JPL\nSimulation of 2003 UB313\'s orbit\nKeck observatory page about the discovery of Dysnomia\nEris (dwarf planet) at AstDyS-2, Asteroids—Dynamic Site\nEphemeris · Observation prediction · Orbital info · Proper elements · Observational info\nEris at the JPL Small-Body Database As the time of perihelion is defined at the epoch chosen using an unperturbed two-body solution, the further the epoch is from the date of perihelion, the less accurate the result. Because Eris was initially thought to be larger than Pluto, it was described as the ""tenth planet"" by NASA and in media reports of its discovery. Classification\nEris is a trans-Neptunian dwarf planet. The discovery team proposed Eris on September 6, 2006. He listed the address of his personal web page announcing the discovery as /~mbrown/planetlila and in the chaos following the controversy over the discovery of Haumea, forgot to change it. This choice was not possible because there was already a minor planet with that name, 399 Persephone, and Eris was being named as a minor planet. It retained this distinction until the discovery of 2018 VG18 in 2018. The IAU subsequently added Eris to its Minor Planet Catalogue, designating it (136199) Eris. In response to the uncertainty over its status, and because of ongoing debate over whether Pluto should be classified as a planet, the IAU delegated a group of astronomers to develop a sufficiently precise definition of the term planet to decide the issue. Because Eris appeared to be larger than Pluto, NASA initially described it as the Solar System\'s tenth planet. The discovery team had reportedly saved the nickname ""Xena"" for the first body they discovered that was larger than Pluto. Xena\nDue to uncertainty over whether the object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because varying nomenclature procedures apply to these classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object had to wait until after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling. Routine observations were taken by the team on October 21, 2003, using the 1.2 m Samuel Oschin Schmidt telescope at Palomar Observatory, California, but the image of Eris was not discovered at that point due to its very slow motion across the sky: The team\'s automatic image-searching software excluded all objects moving at less than 1.5 arcseconds per hour to reduce the number of false positives returned. Eris (minor-planet designation: 136199 Eris) is the most massive and second-largest known dwarf planet in the Solar System. This was announced as the IAU\'s Definition of a Planet in the Solar System, adopted on August 24, 2006. At this time, both Eris and Pluto were classified as dwarf planets, a category distinct from the new definition of planet. ""Xena"" was an informal name used internally by the discovery team, inspired by the title character of the television series Xena: Warrior Princess. Discovery\nEris was discovered by the team of Mike Brown, Chad Trujillo, and David Rabinowitz on January 5, 2005, from images taken on October 21, 2003. Surface and atmosphere\nThe discovery team followed up their initial identification of Eris with spectroscopic observations made at the 8 m Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii on January 25, 2005. Brown decided that, because the object had been considered a planet for so long, it deserved a name from Greek or Roman mythology like the other planets. With the exception of long-period comets, Eris and Dysnomia were the most distant known natural objects in the Solar System until the discovery of 2018 AG37 and 2018 VG18 in 2018. The discovery was announced on July 29, 2005, the same day as Makemake and two days after Haumea, due in part to events that would later lead to controversy about Haumea. This, along with the prospect of other objects of similar size being discovered in the future, motivated the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term planet for the first time. The search team had been systematically scanning for large outer Solar System bodies for several years, and had been involved in the discovery of several other large TNOs, including the dwarf planets Quaoar, Orcus, and Sedna. According to Brown,\n\nWe chose it since it started with an X (planet ""X""), it sounds mythological ... and we\'ve been working to get more female deities out there (e.g. Under the IAU definition approved on August 24, 2006, Eris, Pluto and Ceres are ""dwarf planets"", reducing the number of known planets in the Solar System to eight, the same as before Pluto\'s discovery in 1930. The team had planned to delay announcing their discoveries of the bright objects Eris and Makemake until further observations and calculations were complete, but announced them ', 'From Planets beyond Neptune:\nDiscovery of Pluto\nLowell\'s sudden death in 1916 temporarily halted the search for Planet X. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930. Planet X\nIn 1894, with the help of William Pickering, Percival Lowell (a wealthy Bostonian) founded the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. Lowell\'s widow, Constance, engaged in a legal battle with the observatory over Lowell\'s legacy which halted the search for Planet X for several years. Clyde Tombaugh\'s discovery of Pluto in 1930 appeared to validate Lowell\'s hypothesis, and Pluto was officially named the ninth planet. In 1929 the observatory\'s director, Vesto Melvin Slipher, summarily handed the job of locating the planet to Clyde Tombaugh, a 22-year-old Kansas farm boy who had only just arrived at the Lowell Observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings. Planet quest: the epic discovery of alien solar systems. In 1925, the observatory obtained glass discs for a new 13 in (33 cm) wide-field telescope to continue the search, constructed with funds from Abbott Lawrence Lowell, Percival\'s brother. Discovery of further trans-Neptunian objects\nAfter the discovery of Pluto and Charon, no more trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) were found until 15760 Albion in 1992. Following the discovery of the planet Neptune in 1846, there was considerable speculation that another planet might exist beyond its orbit. Even before Neptune\'s discovery, some speculated that one planet alone was not enough to explain the discrepancy. Pluto loses Planet X title\nTo the observatory\'s disappointment and surprise, Pluto showed no visible disc; it appeared as a point, no different from a star, and, at only 15th magnitude, was six times dimmer than Lowell had predicted, which meant it was either very small, or very dark. Today, most astronomers agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Barely a month after its discovery was announced, on April 14, 1930, in an article in The New York Times, Armin O. Leuschner suggested that Pluto\'s dimness and high orbital eccentricity made it more similar to an asteroid or comet: ""The Lowell result confirms the possible high eccentricity announced by us on April 5. In 1850 James Ferguson, Assistant Astronomer at the United States Naval Observatory, noted that he had ""lost"" a star he had observed, GR1719k, which Lt. Matthew Maury, the superintendent of the Observatory, claimed was evidence that it must be a new planet. However, the discovery of Eris did not rehabilitate the Planet X theory because it is far too small to have significant effects on the outer planets\' orbits. Lowell\'s prediction had been a coincidence: If there was a Planet X, it was not Pluto. In 1900 and 1901, Harvard College Observatory director William Henry Pickering led two searches for trans-Neptunian planets. Planet Nine\nIn 2014, astronomers announced the discovery of 2012 VP113, a large object with a Sedna-like 4,200-year orbit and a perihelion of roughly 80 AU, which led them to suggest that it offered evidence of a potential trans-Neptunian planet. The search began in the mid-19th century and continued at the start of the 20th with Percival Lowell\'s quest for Planet X. Lowell proposed the Planet X hypothesis to explain apparent discrepancies in the orbits of the giant planets, particularly Uranus and Neptune, speculating that the gravity of a large unseen ninth planet could have perturbed Uranus enough to account for the irregularities. Naval Observatory, to measure the mass of the Pluto–Charon system directly by observing the moon\'s orbital motion around Pluto. The object was just six degrees from one of two locations for Planet X  Lowell had suggested; thus it seemed he had at last been vindicated. These hypothetical objects are often referred to as ""Planet X"", although the conception of these objects may differ considerably from that proposed by Lowell. After revising his predicted possible locations, Lowell conducted a second search from 1914 to 1916. Tombaugh decided to image the entire zodiac, rather than focus on those regions suggested by Lowell. Because of Lowell\'s predictions, astronomers thought that Pluto would be massive enough to perturb planets. This means that unless its discovery was a freak accident, there is probably a substantial population of objects roughly Sedna\'s diameter yet to be observed in its orbital region. Unbeknownst to Pickering, four of the photographic plates taken in the search for ""Planet O"" by astronomers at the Mount Wilson Observatory in 1919 captured images of Pluto, though this was only recognised years later. Subsequently proposed trans-Neptunian planets\nAlthough most astronomers accept that Lowell\'s Planet X does not exist, a number have revived the idea that a large unseen planet could create observable gravitational effects in the outer Solar System. Plates taken at his observato', ""From Voyager 1:\nAfter a reboot of the FDS, communications remained unusable. It was launched 16 days after its twin, Voyager 2. It was caused by the probe's fault protection system that was activated after NASA turned on one of the heaters on October 16. After the first roll the spacecraft had no problem in reorienting itself with Alpha Centauri, Voyager 1's guide star, and it resumed sending transmissions back to Earth. Voyager 1 is a space probe launched by NASA on September 5, 1977, as part of the Voyager program to study the outer Solar System and the interstellar space beyond the Sun's heliosphere. It communicates through the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) to receive routine commands and to transmit data to Earth. Real-time distance and velocity data are provided by NASA and JPL. At a distance of 166.28 AU (24.9 billion km; 15.5 billion mi) from Earth as of December 2024, it is the most distant human-made object from Earth. The probe made flybys of Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn's largest moon, Titan. NASA had a choice of either doing a Pluto or Titan flyby; exploration of the moon took priority because it was known to have a substantial atmosphere. Voyager 1 studied the weather, magnetic fields, and rings of the two gas giants and was the first probe to provide detailed images of their moons. As part of the Voyager program and like its sister craft Voyager 2, the spacecraft's extended mission is to locate and study the regions and boundaries of the outer heliosphere and to begin exploring the interstellar medium. Voyager 1 crossed the heliopause and entered interstellar space on August 25, 2012, making it the first spacecraft to do so. Two years later, Voyager 1 began experiencing a third wave of coronal mass ejections from the Sun that continued to at least December 15, 2014, further confirming that the probe is in interstellar space. In 2017, the Voyager team successfully fired the spacecraft's trajectory correction maneuver (TCM) thrusters for the first time since 1980, enabling the mission to be extended by two to three years. Voyager 1's extended mission is expected to continue to return scientific data until at least 2025, with a maximum lifespan of until 2030. Its radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) may supply enough electric power to return engineering data until 2036. Mission background\nHistory\nA 1960s proposal for a Grand Tour to study the outer planets led NASA to begin work on a mission during the early 1970s. Information gathered by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft helped engineers design Voyager to better cope with the intense radiation around Jupiter. Still, shortly before launch, strips of kitchen-grade aluminum foil were applied to certain cables to improve radiation shielding. Initially, Voyager 1 was planned as Mariner 11 of the Mariner program. Due to budget cuts, the mission was reduced to a flyby of Jupiter and Saturn and renamed the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. The name was changed to Voyager when the probe designs began to differ substantially from Mariner missions. Spacecraft components\nVoyager 1 was built by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing instruments to keep the probe's radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments are part of the Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and eight backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific instruments to study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space. Communication system\nThe radio communication system of Voyager 1 was designed to be used up to and beyond the limits of the Solar System. It has a 3.7-metre (12 ft) diameter high-gain Cassegrain antenna to send and receive radio waves via the three Deep Space Network stations on the Earth. The spacecraft normally transmits data to Earth over Deep Space Network Channel 18, using a frequency of either 2.3 GHz or 8.4 GHz, while signals from Earth to Voyager are transmitted at 2.1 GHz. When Voyager 1 is unable to communicate with the Earth, its digital tape recorder (DTR) can record about 67 megabytes of data for later transmission. As of 2023, signals from Voyager 1 take more than 22 hours to reach Earth. Power\nVoyager 1 has three radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) mounted on a boom. Each MHW-RTG contains 24 pressed plutonium-238 oxide spheres. The RTGs generated about 470 W of electric power at the time of launch, with the remainder being dissipated as waste heat. The power output of the RTGs declines over time due to the 87.7-year half-life of the fuel and degradation of the thermocouples, but they will continue to support some of its operations until at least 2025. Computers\nUnlike Voyager's other instruments, the operation of the cameras for visible light is not autonomous, but is controlled by an imaging parameter table contained in one of the  digital computers, the Flight Data Subsystem (FD"", ""From Meanings of minor-planet names: 8001–9000:\nAs minor planet discoveries are confirmed, they are given a permanent number by the IAU's Minor Planet Center (MPC), and the discoverers can then submit names for them, following the IAU's naming conventions.

K. Chesterton who never used a useless word, who saw the value of a paradox, and avoided what was trite."" Gilbert Keith Chesterton  (29 May 1874 – 14 June 1936) was an English author, philosopher, Christian apologist, and literary and art critic. Chesterton created the fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and wrote on apologetics, such as his works Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an orthodox Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting from high church Anglicanism. Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, John Henry Newman and John Ruskin. He has been referred to as the ""prince of paradox"". Of his writing style, Time observed: ""Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories—first carefully turning them inside out."" His writings were an influence on Jorge Luis Borges, who compared his work with that of Edgar Allan Poe. Biography\nEarly life\nChesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, on 29 May 1874. His father was Edward Chesterton, an estate agent, and his mother was Marie Louise, née Grosjean, of Swiss-French origin. Chesterton was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England, though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians. According to his autobiography, as a young man he became fascinated with the occult and, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards. He was educated at St Paul\'s School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but he did not complete a degree in either subject. He married Frances Blogg in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to Anglicanism, though he later considered Anglicanism to be a ""pale imitation"". He entered in full communion with the Catholic Church in 1922. The couple were unable to have children. A friend from schooldays was Edmund Clerihew Bentley, inventor of the clerihew, a whimsical four-line biographical poem. Chesterton himself wrote clerihews and illustrated his friend\'s first published collection of poetry, Biography for Beginners (1905), which popularised the clerihew form. He became godfather to Bentley\'s son, Nicolas, and opened his novel The Man Who Was Thursday with a poem written to Bentley. Career\nIn September 1895, Chesterton began working for the London publisher George Redway, where he remained for just over a year. During this period he also undertook his first journalistic work, as a freelance art and literary critic. In 1902, The Daily News gave him a weekly opinion column, followed in 1905 by a weekly column in The Illustrated London News, for which he continued to write for the next thirty years. Early on Chesterton showed a great interest in and talent for art. He had planned to become an artist, and his writing shows a vision that clothed abstract ideas in concrete and memorable images. Father Brown is perpetually correcting the incorrect vision of the bewildered folks at the scene of the crime and wandering off at the end with the criminal to exercise his priestly role of recognition, repentance and reconciliation. For example, in the story ""The Flying Stars"", Father Brown entreats the character Flambeau to give up his life of crime: ""There is still youth and honour and humour in you; don\'t fancy they will last in that trade. Men may keep a sort of level of good, but no man has ever been able to keep on one level of evil.

During the First World War (1914–1918), Germany published several newspapers and magazines for the enemy areas it occupied.

The perils of print culture: book, print and publishing history in theory and practice. History\nPublishing became possible with the invention of writing and became more practical upon the introduction of printing. Wikis and blogs soon developed, followed by online books, online newspapers, and online magazines. With the advent of digital information systems, the scope has expanded to include digital publishing such as e-books, digital magazines, websites, social media, music, and video game publishing. Traditionally, the term refers to the creation and distribution of printed works, such as books, comic books, newspapers, and magazines. Magazines are available in print or digital formats and can be purchased on apps or websites like Readly or accessed free of charge on apps or websites like Issuu. Book publishing sub-divisions\nThe publishing landscape is continually evolving. Green publishing means adapting the publishing process to minimize environmental impact. It has various divisions such as trade/retail publishing of fiction and non-fiction, educational publishing, and academic and scientific publishing. Book publishing\nThe global book publishing industry consists of books categorized as fiction or non-fiction and print, e-book, or audiobook. Hybrid publishing is the source of debate in the publishing industry, due to the  tendency of vanity presses to masquerade as hybrids. ""Publisher"" can refer to a publishing company, organization, or an individual who leads a publishing company, imprint, periodical, or newspaper. Magazine publishing\nA magazine is a periodical published at regular intervals. External links\n\nInternational Publishers\' organisation\nPrinting and publishing – Law Insider Stages of publishing\nThe publishing process covering most magazine, journal, and book publishers includes: (Different stages are applicable to different types of publishers)\n\nTypes of publishers\nNewspaper publishing\nNewspapers or news websites are publications of current reports, articles, and features written by journalists. Due to printing, publishing progressed hand-in-hand with the development of books. The need for textbook publishing continues due to the global need for education. Historically, publishing has been handled by publishers, although some authors self-published. Self-publishing makes publishing widely accessible through small print-run digital printing or online self-publishing platforms. Directory publishing\nDirectories contain searchable indexed data about businesses, products, and services. Web publishing\nUntil recently, physical books were the primary source of recording knowledge. Lack of diversity in the American publishing industry has been an issue for years. Tie-in publishing\nFilm, television, radio, and advertisements publish information to their audiences. Examples of tie-in publishing based on books are the Harry Potter and James Bond franchises. Given the bad reputation of vanity publishing, many vanity presses brand themselves as hybrid publishers. A further development is the growth of online publishing, where no physical books are produced. They usually have peer review processes before publishing to test the validity and quality of the content. The BBC has its own publishing division that does very well with long-running series such as Doctor Who. The establishment of the World Wide Web in 1989 soon propelled the website into a dominant publishing medium. Hybrid publishing\nA hybrid publisher shares the costs of publication (and therefore the risks) with the author. Privishing\nPrivishing (private publishing, but not to be confused with self-publishing) is a modern term for publishing a book but printing so few copies or with such lack of marketing, advertising, or sales support that it effectively does not reach the public. In exchange, the publisher will take care of all aspects of publishing the book at the publisher\'s cost. Marketing additional products closely related to a major film, such as Star Wars, is an example of tie-in publishing. Currently there are four major types of publishers in book publishing:\n\nMainstream publishers\nThese companies traditionally produce hardcopy books in large print runs. the author surrenders some rights in exchange for the publisher bearing all costs of publishing), but their precise terms can vary greatly. Publishing has evolved from a small, ancient form limited by law or religion to a modern, large-scale industry disseminating all types of information. Also, using social media publishing to advertise has a good ROI if trending, high-quality content is created that reflects positively on the brand. A U.S.-based study in 2016 that surveyed 34 publishers found that straight, able-bodied, white females overwhelmingly represent the publishing industry in the US. Self-publishing\nWhen an author self-publishes a book, they retain all', 'From Cover date:\nThe cover date of a periodical publication is the date displayed on the cover, which is not necessarily the true date of publication (the on-sale date or release date); later cover dates are common in magazine and  comic book publishing. In 1989 the cover date and publishing date discrepancy was changed back to two months, though generally each comic book company now uses its own system. There are two reasons for this discrepancy: first, to allow magazines to continue appearing ""current"" to consumers even after they have been on sale for some time (since not all magazines will be sold immediately), and second, to inform newsstands when an unsold magazine can be removed from the stands and returned to the publishing company or be destroyed (in this case, the cover date is also the pull date). Of the two major American comic book publishers, DC Comics continues to put cover dates on the cover. Marvel Comics opted against putting cover dates on the cover in October 1999; instead, the ""cover"" date was moved to the indicia on an interior page. Magazines\nIn the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the standard practice is to display on magazine covers a date which is some weeks or months in the future from the publishing or release date. More unusually, Le Monde is a daily newspaper published the afternoon before its cover date. For some publications, the cover date may not be found on the cover, but rather on an inside jacket or on an interior page. Weeklies (such as Time and Newsweek) are generally dated a week ahead. Monthlies (such as National Geographic) are generally dated two to three months ahead, and quarterlies are generally dated half a month ahead. In other countries, the cover date usually matches more closely the date of publication, and may indeed be identical where weekly magazines are concerned. In all markets, it is rare for monthly magazines to indicate a particular day of the month: thus issues are dated May 2016, and so on, whereas weekly magazines may be dated 17 May 2016. Comic books\nThe general practice of most mainstream comic book companies since the creation of the comic book in the 1930s was to date individual issues by putting the name of a month (and much later the year as well) on the cover which was generally two months after the release date. For example, a 1951 issue of Superman which had the cover date of July would have been published two months earlier from that date in the month of May, generally speaking. In 1973 the discrepancy between the cover date and the publishing date went from two months to three months. == References ==']","Marion Couthouy Smith published her books and poems in Harper's Magazine, Century Magazine, Atlantic Monthly, and The New England Magazine.

They are restricted to suitable breeding and feeding grounds, making novel niche exploration rare, particularly in fast flowing drainages. Anthropogenic influences and conservation implications\nThe low mobility and habitat specialization associated with the subgenus make Nothonotus species particularly sensitive to habitat degradation. Nothonotus species\nFishBase lists the following four species:\nNothonotus aquali (Williams & Etnier, 1978) (Coppercheek darter)\nNothonotus microlepidus (Raney & Zorach, 1967) (Smallscale darter)\nNothonotus sanguifluus (Cope, 1870) (Bloodfin darter)\nNothonotus starnesi Keck & Near, 2013 (Caney fork darter)\nThomas Near and colleagues also included the following, which, where they are described at all in this treatment, are listed under Etheostoma. Nothonotus is a genus or subgenus of freshwater ray-finned fish, a darter from the subfamily Etheostomatinae, part of the family Percidae, which also contains the perches, ruffes and pikeperches. It is endemic to the southeastern United States. First proposed as a sub-genus of Etheostoma in 1988, there is still debate regarding the appropriate taxonomic rank of Nothonotus in the literature . Darter species comprise more than 180 of the Percidae taxa. N. acuticeps\nN. bellus\nN. camurus\nN. chlorobranchius\nN. chuckwachattee\nN. denoncourti\nN. douglasi\nN. etowahae\nN. jordani\nN. juliae\nN. maculatus\nN. moorei\nN. rubrus\nN. rufilineatus\nN. tippecanoe\nN. vulneratus\nN. wapiti\n\nPhylogenetics\nMembers of the Nothonotus subspecies last shared a common ancestor approximately 18.5 MYA. Frequent hybridization, the rich diversity of the subgenus, and the limitations of the fossil record complicate phylogenetic assessments, which have not been fully resolved. Various conflicting relationships have been proposed using morphological characters, allozyme analysis, microsatellites, and mtDNA sequencing. Life history\nNothonotus darters are native to the riffle domains of highly graded drainages in North America. Nothonotus species vary in locality preference, but are known to cooccur in several drainages in the Eastern United States. Nothonotus darters engage in three reproductive strategies: egg burial, egg guarding, and egg tending, strategies hypothesized to have evolved multiple times. Most species have limited mobility, moving approximately 33–100 meters per year. Low mobility is hypothesized to have facilitated speciation in regions where multiple species appear to have historical sympatric distributions. Various life history traits like body size determine the niche range available to a particular species. The biogeographic dispersal model has been proposed as the most likely explanation of diversification and speciation of the subgenera. It has also been postulated that speciation occurred following niche partitioning, in response to competition where distributions overlap. Darter populations are frequently assessed as a proxy for stream habitat quality. In a comparative species richness survey, museum specimen from 1948-1955 contained approximately 33% more diversity than samples collected from 2005-2006 in the same localities despite more intensive sampling efforts in contemporary populations. The following Nothonotus species have been designated conservation statuses by IUCN redlist: Vulnerable : N. maculatum, N. acuticeps, N. denoncourti, N. etowahae, N. wapiti;  Near threatened: N. aquali, N. tippecanoe; Endangered: N. moorei, N. rubrum. Impoundment by dams and siltation restrict gene flow between previously continuous populations, threatening the genetic diversity of various Nothonotus species. Siltation has been cited as the most concerning mode of habitat destruction in aquatic habitats. Sediment issues occur when anthropogenic activities like mining, deforestation, urbanization, and road construction alter flow regimes and erosion rates. Coloration, particularly conspicuous in males, is hypothesized to have evolved in response to sexual selection and habitat preference. Species residing higher in the water column, in clear water, and in habitats with low predation typically express stronger nuptial coloration patterns. Sedimentation may also interfere with mate identification due to reduced water clarity. == References ==', 'From Stephen Decatur:\nAfter catching up with and pulling alongside the Tripolitan ship, Decatur was the first to board the enemy vessel with Midshipman Macdonough at his heels along with nine volunteer crew members. Decatur had just captured his first Tripolitan vessel and upon receiving the news turned command of his captured prize over to Lieutenant Jonathan Thorn and immediately set out to avenge his brother\'s treacherous injury. Later James Decatur was taken aboard Constitution where he was joined by his brother Stephen, who stayed with him until he had died. Stephen Decatur died childless. His parents had arrived from Philadelphia just three months before Stephen was born, fleeing the city during the American Revolutionary War due to its occupation by British forces. During the fighting Decatur\'s younger brother, James Decatur, in command of a gunboat, was mortally wounded by a Tripolitan captain during the boarding of a vessel feigning surrender. The next day, after a funeral and military ceremony that was conducted by Preble, Stephen Decatur saw his brother\'s remains committed to the depths of the Mediterranean. First Barbary War\nThe first war against the Barbary States was in response to the frequent piracy of American vessels in the Mediterranean Sea and the capture and enslavement of American crews for huge ransoms.

Decatur\'s squadron of ten ships was ready first and set sail for Algiers on May 20. On board the vessel were official documents promoting Decatur to the rank of captain. Decatur had emerged as a national hero in his own lifetime, becoming the first post–Revolutionary War hero. His father, Stephen Decatur Sr., was a commodore in the Continental Navy during the American Revolutionary War; he brought the younger Stephen into the world of ships and sailing early on. Departing for the Mediterranean on June 1, this squadron was the first American naval squadron to cross the Atlantic. Consequently, the vessel was taken up the Delaware to Chester, Pennsylvania, for repairs. When Stephen was eight years old, he developed a severe case of whooping cough. As had occurred during the First Barbary War American merchant ships and crews were once again being seized and held for large ransoms. Decatur\'s first home in Washington was 1903 Pennsylvania Avenue (one of the ""Seven Buildings""), purchased in 1817. Decatur  first asked his friend Thomas Macdonough to be his second, but Macdonough declined the request because he had always opposed dueling. His parents had different aspirations, especially his mother who had hopes that Stephen would one day become an Episcopal clergyman, and tried to discourage the eight-year-old from such jaunty ambitions, fearing such would distract Stephen from his studies. Decatur\'s vessel was made to look like a common merchant ship from Malta and was outfitted with British colours. After a brief engagement Decatur and his crew captured the ship, killing or wounding the few men defending the vessel. While United States was undergoing repairs Decatur received orders to remain in Philadelphia to recruit and assemble a crew for the vessel. On May 13, 1801, at the beginning of the war, Decatur was assigned duty aboard the frigate USS Essex to serve as the first lieutenant. It was decided that Stephen Jr. would accompany his father aboard a merchant ship on his next voyage to Europe. On November 6, he relinquished command of Constitution to Commodore John Rodgers, his senior, in exchange for the smaller vessel Congress. Decatur and his men left the burning vessel in Tripoli\'s harbor and set sail for the open sea, barely escaping in the confusion. Commodore Stephen Decatur Jr. (; January 5, 1779 – March 22, 1820) was a United States Navy officer. News of the incident soon reached President Jefferson, the Department of the Navy and Decatur, who was outraged, was the one who was first confronted with the matter. He was serving on board this vessel as a midshipman when it was launched on May 10, 1797, under the command of Commodore John Barr', 'From Thomas FitzStephen:\nFitzStephen owned and captained the White Ship, which at that time was docked at Barfleur harbour. The White Ship was fast, of the best construction and had recently been fitted with new materials, which made the captain and crew confident they could reach England first. Sire king, I beg you to grant me the same office in fief: I have a vessel called the Blanche-Nef, well equipped and manned with fifty skilful mariners."" When Thomas FitzStephen presented himself to the king he said: \n\n""Stephen, my father, served yours all his life by sea, and he it was who steered the ship in which your father sailed for the conquest of England. Life\nFitzStephen was the son of Stephen FitzAirard (Old French: Estienne fiz Airard), the captain of the Mora, the ship which brought William the Conqueror over from Normandy during his invasion of England in 1066. FitzStephen and his crew were challenged by the revelers to overtake the king\'s ship which had already sailed. The loss of life was devastating – according to Orderic Vitalis only one survived, by clinging to the rock all night: a butcher from Rouen. By the time the ship was ready to leave there were about 300 people on board although some had disembarked before the ship sailed due to the excessive drinking. Thomas FitzStephen (Old French: Thomas fiz Estienne; died 1120) was captain of the ill-fated White Ship (French: la Blanche-Nef), which sank off Barfleur, Normandy, on 25 November 1120. Henry had already made other arrangements, but gave permission for his sons William Adelin and Richard, as well as the young nobles in William\'s entourage, to travel on it instead. According to Orderic Vitalis, the nobles as well as the crew were drinking. However, when the ship set off in the dark, its port side struck a submerged rock and the ship quickly capsized and sank. Orderic also claims that FitzStephen let himself drown rather than face the wrath of King Henry I, as Henry\'s son William Adelin had been among those drowned.

In the book, after attending a march by Vietnam Veterans Against the War in Washington, D.C., Frankie encounters two volunteers for the National League of POW/MIA Families, from whom she buys a silver cuff bracelet on which the name of a missing soldier and the date of his disappearance are engraved: ""Maj. Robert Welch 1-16-1967."" She began to work on it in early 2020, shortly after completing her novel The Four Winds. Hannah chose Frankie to be the novel\'s central character, as opposed to fellow combat nurses Ethel or Barb, partly due to Frankie\'s naivete and Southern California origin, which Hannah felt she could empathize with due to her own upbringing in Garden Grove, California. The novel debuted at number one on The New York Times fiction best-seller list. In her review for The Boston Globe, Meredith Maran panned the novel for resorting to cliché and criticized Hannah for ""underestimating her readers"", concluding, ""Cut by half, edited to delete the predictable, the ""matronizing,"" and the obvious, The Women would have been an even stronger contribution to Hannah\'s body of work, and to her millions of fans\' understanding of American history."" As of the week ending March 30, 2024, the novel spent 8 consecutive weeks atop the list.

Kirkus Reviews assessed the novel as a ""dramatic, vividly detailed reconstruction of a little-known aspect of the Vietnam War."" Reception\nThe novel debuted at number one on The New York Times fiction best-seller list for the week ending February 10, 2024. She deploys details to visceral effect."" Film adaptation\nIn January 2024, Warner Bros. preemptively acquired the screen rights to The Women for a film adaptation. It was developed during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic while she was confined to her home on a small island outside Seattle. That\'s when I knew I was ready to write about the women who served in the war and were forgotten at home. In her research, Hannah read several memoirs by nurses who served in Vietnam, many of whom experienced difficulty adjusting to civilian life and were afflicted with post-traumatic stress disorder. Alice Cary of BookPage wrote that ""Hannah demonstrates her knack for blending broad sweeps of history with page-turning plots to immediately engross legions of readers in even the most difficult of subjects."" In an interview with LibraryThing, Hannah commented: For years, I wanted to write about the turbulence and chaos and division of the times, but it wasn\'t until the pandemic, when I was on lockdown in Seattle, confined to my home essentially, and watching our nurses and doctors serving on the front lines of the pandemic, becoming exhausted amid the political division of the time that it all came together for me. The book tells the story of Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath, a young nurse who serves in the United States Army Nurse Corps during the Vietnam War. The story centered on a nurse and was initially a love story. She would occasionally revisit the project only put it aside again. The book was inspired by Hannah\'s experience growing up during the war era, which she says ""cast a huge shadow across [her] life"". She was influenced by the public protests, marches, and social division about the war at the time as well as the later treatment of veterans upon returning home. Hannah also spoke about wearing a silver prisoner of war bracelet when she was about 10 years old, one which commemorated her close friend\'s father who had been shot down as pilot in the war. Her friend\'s father never returned home, and she wore the bracelet for many years, and as a result ""was reminded of him and his service and war each day.""

Barbie: The idea of a live-action Barbie film had been in development at Cannon Films in the mid-1980s; little is known about it, other than a promotional blurb (with the plotline centering around Barbie showing her owner how all her dreams could come true), and it is unclear how far into development it got before Mattel ceased working with Cannon, following Cannon\'s live-action adaptation of Masters of the Universe (1987) flopping at the box-office. It was originally developed under the original title Gharoanda (Hindi for ""nest"", literally ""house of twigs""), but was withheld by company R.K. i/o received notoriety for its repeated delays, with Rolling Stone calling it the ""Chinese Democracy of Peter Gabriel albums"", and Stereogum calling it ""the Smile (or perhaps the Chinese Democracy) of art-rock."" Gabriel repeatedly gave vague updates on the album\'s production over the following years, first stating in 2008 that he was ""shifting focus"" towards both i/o and his cover album Scratch My Back (which saw release in 2010) before later claiming in 2011 that i/o was still just a number of unfinished ""song ideas"" that he had yet to elaborate upon. On August 4, Linklater left the project to concentrate on his next film That\'s What I\'m Talking About (released in 2016 as Everybody Wants Some!!). The timeline was pushed back a total of 8 times, due to director James Cameron being occupied with other projects, the VFX (visual effects) team working on creating underwater motion capture, and the COVID-19 pandemic affecting production. Being delayed significantly from its originally planned launch in 2024 according to leaked documents, producer Todd Howard said in 2021 that the game would come ""some fifteen to seventeen years after Skyrim"" (2026 to 2028), and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer estimated in 2023 that the game\'s release was still ""five plus years away"" (indicating a launch of 2028 or later), suggesting further delays.

Her film breakthrough came later in 2005 when Williams appeared in Ang Lee\'s drama Brokeback Mountain, about the romance between two men, Ennis and Jack (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, respectively). Consistently private about her personal life, Williams has a daughter from her relationship with actor Heath Ledger and was briefly married to musician Phil Elverum. Based on Dennis Lehane\'s novel, it featured her as a depressed housewife who drowns her own children. Based on the Oz children\'s books, it served as a prequel to the 1939 classic film The Wizard of Oz. Five months after giving birth to her daughter, she returned to work on Ethan Hawke\'s directorial venture The Hottest State, based on his own novel. She gave birth to their son later in 2020 and another child in 2022. Although reluctant to publicly discuss her romantic relationships, Williams was forthright in expressing her grief over Ledger\'s death, saying it had left a permanent hole in both her and her daughter\'s life. In her first public statement, a week after his death, she expressed her heartbreak and described Ledger\'s spirit as surviving in their daughter. Kenneth Lonergan\'s Manchester by the Sea starred Casey Affleck as Lee, a depressed man who separates from his wife, Randi (Williams), following the tragic death of their children. She has two children with her second husband, theater director Thomas Kail. Williams began dating Ledger while working on the film. The couple cohabited in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, New York, and in 2005, she gave birth to their daughter Matilda. Williams had just separated from Ledger and was relieved for the anonymity the project provided. The series was shot in Wilmington, North Carolina, where she lived for the six years of filming. Her first film release since the debut of Dawson\'s Creek was the Jamie Lee Curtis-starring slasher picture Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (1998)—the seventh installment in the Halloween film series—in which she played one of several teenagers traumatized by the murderer Michael Myers. She has said of the experience, ""It was less happy probably by virtue of it being my preteen years, which are perhaps unpleasant wherever you go."" When funding came through after years of delay, she was reluctant to accept the offer as filming in California would take her away from her daughter for too long. Eager to work in a different medium and finding it tough to obtain film roles that enabled her to maintain her parental commitments, Williams spent the next few years working on the stage. Williams was filming in Sweden for her next project, Mammoth (2009), when news broke that Ledger had died of an accidental intoxication from prescription drugs. Roger Ebert considered Williams\'s performance to be the film\'s prime asset and credited her for successfully evoking multiple aspects of Monroe\'s personality. She was pleased with Reichardt\'s minimalistic approach and identified with her character\'s self-sufficiency and fortitude. Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times praised Wenders\'s thoughtful examination of the subject and noted Williams\'s screen appeal. Set entirely in the lunchroom of an office, it focuses on a young woman (Williams), who confronts a much older man (played by Jeff Daniels) for having sexual relations with her when she was twelve years old. She likened her character\'s joyful disposition to that of Grace Kelly, and she sang two songs for the film\'s soundtrack. Ridley Scott\'s crime thriller All the Money in the World (2017) was Williams\'s first leading role in film since 2013. Even in her slapstick, there\'s pain."" Williams\'s two other releases of 2008 were better received. The series was a ratings success and raised Williams\'s profile. Williams has also led major studio films, such as Ridley Scott\'s crime thriller All the Money in the World (2017) and Steven Spielberg\'s semi-autobiographical drama The Fabelmans (2022). Williams agreed to the project to work with Lonergan, whom she admired, and despite the film\'s bleakness she found a connection with her character\'s desire to reclaim her life in the face of tragedy. Several critics hailed Williams\'s climactic monologue, in which Randi confronts Lee, as the film\'s highlight; Justin Chang termed it an ""astonishing scene that rises from the movie like a small aria of heartbreak."" Deeming her the standout among the cast, Ed Gonzalez of Slant Magazine commended Williams for ""fascinatingly spiking [Alma\'s] unspoken resentment for her sham of a marriage with a hint of compassion for Ennis\'s secret suffering"". Williams had first read the script for Derek Cianfrance\'s romantic drama Blue Valentine at age 21. In a mixed review of the film, Ken Tucker criticized Williams for overplaying her character\'s eagerness. The critic David Edelstein bemoaned that Williams\'s work h', 'From Heath Ledger:\nHe also felt that Ledger had a rare maturity beyond his years."" He was only 28 years old.

On 4 April 2017, a trailer was released for the documentary I Am Heath Ledger, which was released on 3 May 2017. Some of Ledger\'s relatives may be challenging the legal status of his will signed in 2003, prior to his involvement with Williams and the birth of their daughter and not updated to include them, which divides half of his estate between his parents and half among his siblings; they claim that there is a second, unsigned will, which leaves most of that estate to Matilda Rose. But Heath\'s went on and I don\'t think he dealt with it immediately with the antibiotics.... In his statement, Miller said specifically, ""Despite tabloid speculation, Mary-Kate Olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in Heath Ledger\'s home or his body, and she does not know where he obtained them."" He added, ""They will be taken care of and that\'s how Heath would want it to be"". Controversy over will\nAfter Ledger\'s death, in response to some press reports about his will, filed in New York City on 28 February 2008, and his daughter\'s access to his financial legacy, his father, Kim Ledger, said that he considered the financial well-being of Heath\'s daughter Matilda Rose an ""absolute priority,"" whilst also stating that her mother, Michelle Williams, was ""an integral part of our family"". ""I\'ve never felt as old as I did watching Heath explore his talents,"" The Dark Knight director Christopher Nolan has written, expressing amazement over the actor\'s working process, genuine curiosity and charisma. Terry Gilliam also refuted the claims that playing the Joker made him crazy, calling it ""absolute nonsense"" and going on to say, ""Heath was so solid. Ledger\'s publicist asserted that reportage regarding Ledger\'s alleged drug use had been inaccurate.

Several actors made statements expressing their sorrow at Ledger\'s death, including Daniel Day-Lewis, who dedicated his Screen Actors Guild Award to him, saying that he was inspired by Ledger\'s acting; Day-Lewis praised Ledger\'s performances in Monster\'s Ball and Brokeback Mountain, describing the latter as ""unique, perfect"". Following talks with the Ledger family in Australia, the academy determined that Ledger\'s daughter, Matilda Rose, would own the award. All of Ledger\'s scenes appear as he completed them in the filming; in editing the film, Nolan added no ""digital effects"" to alter Ledger\'s actual performance posthumously. The three actors donated their fees for the film to Ledger\'s and Williams\'s daughter. A few days later, reports citing telephone interviews with Ledger\'s uncles Haydn and Mike Ledger and the family of the other little girl, published in OK! In 2007, director Todd Haynes compared Ledger\'s presence to actor James Dean, casting Ledger as Robbie Clarke, a fictive personification of Bob Dylan in I\'m Not There. Ledger\'s subsequent nomination was announced on 22 January 2009, the anniversary of his death. On 31 March 2008, stimulating another controversy pertaining to Ledger\'s estate, Gemma Jones and Janet Fife-Yeomans published an ""Exclusive"" report, in The Daily Telegraph, citing Ledger\'s uncle Haydn Ledger and other family members, who ""believe the late actor may have fathered a secret love child"" when he was 17, and stating that ""If it is confirmed that Ledger is the girl\'s biological father, it could split his multi-million dollar estate between ... Matilda Rose ... and his secret love child."" Film critics, co-stars Maggie Gyllenhaal and Michael Caine and many of Ledger\'s peers in the film community joined Bale in calling for and predicting a nomination for the 2008 Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in recognition of Ledger', 'From The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus:\nEffects of Heath Ledger\'s death\nProduction was halted by the death of Heath Ledger in New York City on 22 January 2008. Depp, Farrell, and Law opted to redirect their wages for the role to Ledger\'s young daughter, Matilda, who had been left out of an old version of Ledger\'s will, and Gilliam altered the part of the credits saying ""A Terry Gilliam film"" to ""A film from Heath Ledger and friends."" In exchange, any child he fathered would become Mr. Nick\'s property at the age of 16. Cast\nHeath Ledger as Tony Shepard. ... That\'s what\'s funny, when Johnny appears so many people think it\'s Heath! Fellow producer Amy Gilliam, Terry\'s daughter, remembered, ""[Bill Vince] always said, \'If you get your film in the can, you\'ll be all right.\' It\'s really a love letter to Heath by everybody involved. The film stars Heath Ledger, Christopher Plummer, Verne Troyer, Andrew Garfield, Lily Cole, Tom Waits, Johnny Depp, Colin Farrell, and Jude Law, though Ledger\'s death one-third of the way through filming caused production to be temporarily suspended. She is married to Anton, has a daughter with him, and lives an affluent life. Ledger\'s involvement had been a ""key factor"" in the film\'s financing. Ledger\'s footage would remain in the film as his character\'s ""real-world"" appearance. Mr. Nick offers Parnassus a new wager: Valentina can stay with Parnassus past the age of 16 if Parnassus wins five souls before Mr. Nick. It was really [...] people\'s love for Heath that propelled this thing forward."" Law was also a friend of Ledger\'s and had been considered for the role of Tony, and Farrell had also been friends with Ledger. Though we were all there in remembrance, Heath\'s heart pushed us with great lightness to the finish. ""Don\'t get me into my mystical mode [...] but the film made itself and it was co-directed by Heath Ledger!""

Being part of this film was never about filling Heath\'s shoes as much as seeing them across the finish line. Plot\nAn elderly sage, Doctor Parnassus, runs a travelling theatre troupe, which includes his teenage daughter Valentina, barker Anton, and dwarf Percy. The film is Ledger\'s final performance; it was dedicated to him and co-producer William Vince. Gilliam said in retrospect about the first transition from Ledger to Depp in the film:\n\nHe\'s extraordinary. Jude Law also commented on the film:\n\nI have always loved Terry Gilliam\'s films. He was compelled to emphasise that upon the film\'s release many things might be mistaken as references to Ledger\'s fate but that the script wasn\'t changed apart from re-casting Tony with Depp, Farrell, and Law. Heath is a marvel, Christopher Plummer beyond anything he\'s ever done, Waits as the Devil is a God, Lily Cole and Andrew Garfield, the very foundation, are spectacular, Verne Troyer simply kicks ass and as for my other cohorts, Colin Farrell and Jude Law, they most certainly did Master Ledger very proud, I salute them. Though the circumstances of my involvement are extremely heart-rending and unbelievably sad, I feel privileged to have been asked aboard to stand in on behalf of dear Heath."" At the same time that an intimate early scene between Andrew Garfield and Lily Cole was being shot on top of the travelling Imaginarium wagon, second unit work around London was also being done for several more nights, until 20 December; this change in schedule was to allow Heath Ledger a break to travel back to Australia to visit his family. Gilliam also positively recalled people\'s commitment to Ledger\'s memory: ""Everyone in the cast and everyone in the crew was determined that this film would be finished and everybody worked longer, harder and somehow we got through. Johnny Depp\'s shooting on the film was the hardest to incorporate into any of the new actors\' schedules, due to his contractual obligation on Michael Mann\'s Public Enemies at the time; in the end, Gilliam had access to Depp for one day and three hours. 2 in both France and Italy, generating the year\'s third-best box office return on an opening weekend in Italy. The imagery would have been similar to transformation techniques seen on Brad Pitt in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and those employed on Roy Scheider\'s performance in his posthumous release Iron Cross. It was an honor to represent Heath. According to Gilliam, actor Colin Farrell also went on record for saying that he hadn\'t been simply playing the character of Tony, but that he was rather feeling like ""channeling Heath"". Gilliam stated, ""I just wanted to keep this [in the] family—it\'s as simple as that [...] There were people even offering to come and help, they didn\'t know Heath.

Most accidents occur on crossings without gates. A significant number of crossings are without barriers. Crossings without lights or gates uses white target boards. On private roads there are level crossings without signals. Some crossings have only crossbucks and also sometimes traffic lights to head a warn drivers of a crossing without main equipment. Crossings without gates have a flashing white light that allows all drivers to pass the level crossing and is fully clear. On public roads they have light signals with or without gates. Older types will have the mechanism for the semi-barrier but without the semi-barrier itself. Crossings without gates uses the second crossbuck in current style with a stop sign below that says ""PARE"" (STOP), which is common to all Latin American countries including Brazil and Ecuador, if is without lights. the former TRA Tamsui Line that is now the Taipei Metro Tamsui Line without any level crossings. Crossings without gates have crossbucks and, at some locations, a stop sign mounted below the lights. If the intersection\'s stop line is right before the tracks (typically sharing the crossing\'s stop line), the track circuits change the traffic lights to red (often without a yellow phase). If it is near a station on a line without BLA, most commonly there will be mechanical barriers controlled by a person. Singapore\'s Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) and Light Rail Transit (LRT) are built without any level crossings; most of the railway network are either underground or elevated. Even without the relocation of KTM terminus to Woodlands Train Checkpoint, level crossings were made redundant with the electrification and double-tracking of the line utilizing overhead railways and to improve traffic speeds and travel time at these roads. The Act Governing the Punishment of Violation of Road Traffic Regulations (Annotated Republic of China Laws/Road Traffic Management and Penalty Act (道路交通管理處罰條例) prescribes fines for drivers and pedestrians who commit certain classes of violations in regards to level crossings; these include disobeying flagmen, insisting to cross while a crossing\'s signals are active or when the gate is being lowered, crossing a passive crossing without stopping beforehand, and overtaking, making a U-turn, backing up, stopping or parking on a railway level crossing in a vehicle. They are also in use with two or three lights and without barriers on tramways at De Panne (until 2021), Zwijndrecht (until 2019), Anderlues, Ghent, and MIVB Line 44 (only here with bells). Costa Rica\nIncofer has crossings with crossbucks as in the photo, with the words ""Cuidado con el tren"" (be careful of the train), as well as crossbucks without lettering, and a normal stop sign (alto). The 2009 Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices requires passive crossings (crossings without actuated flashing lights or gates) to have either stop signs or yield signs in addition to the crossbuck, unless a flagger will stop traffic every time a train approaches. Since in Hungary the white flashing light is called an idle signal, it only means the device is in working order, and the drivers may cross the railway without stopping if they deem it safe, yet should they still do so with caution. Devices and signaling arranged at horizontal lines\nGuarded crossroads: barrier or shields, signal lights, electric bells, signboards, marker poles, fences, road markings on roads, railroad roadside signals (if any), and other signaling devices when permitted by competent authorities;\nAutomatic warning crossings: signal lights, electric bells, signboards, marker posts or fences, with or without automatic barrier, road markings on road, and other signaling devices when possible authorized level;\nRoads across the crossing: signboards, marker posts or fences, road markings, and other signaling devices when so permitted by competent authorities. The crossing gates and lights are based on crossing equipment used in France. A tram track in its own right-of-way crossing a road can also be classified as a level crossing if it is signed with a crossbuck reading either ""tramway crossing"" or ""railway crossing"". Operation of a typical AWD-equipped railroad crossing in the United States is as follows:\n\nAbout 30 seconds before arriving at the crossing, the train trips a track circuit near the crossing, triggering the crossing signals. Most crossings on major railway lines are manned, with a crossing operator operating the crossing. As traffic on the road crossing or the rail crossing increases, safety features are increased accordingly. Usually each level crossing has a small guard room to control the traffic and barriers at the crossing. Every level crossing with barriers is manned by a crossing keeper, who depending on the crossing type, may operate it, or if it is automatic, ensure its correct operation. Vietnam\nAll railroad crossing signs in Vietnam are based on the Russian Federation', ""From Calvin Johnson:\nOn January 8, 2007, Johnson declared himself eligible for the NFL Draft, bypassing his senior season at Georgia Tech. The Lions lost the game by a score of 19–14. Johnson was selected by the Detroit Lions in the first round as the second pick overall in the 2007 NFL draft. This gave the Lions their first victory of the season after an 0–5 start. 2008 season\nJohnson and the Lions faced the Atlanta Falcons on the road on September 7, 2008, in the season opener at the Georgia Dome. However, Johnson missed the Pro Bowl, with most experts attributing the snub to the Lions' dismal winless season. The Lions, being told by the league that Johnson would have to skip the minicamp to attend, rescheduled the camp to accommodate Johnson. The Lions finished with a 11–5 record and earned a playoff spot in the Wild Card Round. The second one gave him the Lions all-time record for touchdown catches with 63, breaking the old mark previously held by Herman Moore. Johnson took five weeks off after the 2007 season and was taking part in the Lions' offseason program. The Lions were expected to trade Johnson, most likely to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but the team announced that they were keeping him. The Lions finished with a 10–6 record, finished second in the NFC North, and earned a playoff berth. Johnson and the 2008 Detroit Lions finished the first ever 0–16 season in NFL history after a 31–21 loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 17. Despite the Lions' failures and the fact that five different quarterbacks played during the year, Johnson finished as one of the strongest wide receivers statistically for the 2008 season, finishing fifth in receiving yards (1,331) and 7th in receiving yards per game (83.2), and leading the league in receiving touchdowns (12), despite the fact that the entire Lions team only passed for 18 touchdowns. He played college football for the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, winning the Fred Biletnikoff Award as a junior, and was selected by the Lions second overall in the 2007 NFL draft. During Week 2 versus the Green Bay Packers, he had two key touchdowns late in the game, which sparked a large comeback, though the Lions eventually lost the game, 48–25. During Week 10, formerly retired All-Pro quarterback Daunte Culpepper was signed to a one-year contract with the Lions in hopes to spur the offense and earned the starting job for the next two games. Johnson and the Lions clinched a playoff spot for the first time since 1999, and the first time in Johnson's career, after a 38–10 beating of the San Diego Chargers on Christmas Eve. With Williams gone and starting quarterback Jon Kitna lost to injury for the season, the Texans defense had little to do to stop the Lions' offense but shut down Johnson, winning the game 28–21. Johnson was seen supporting the Lions at Ford Field as they secured their first playoff win since 1992 where they beat the Los Angeles Rams 24–23. More recently, Johnson's stance has softened as he attended several Detroit Lions team practices during the 2023 season and the September 17, 2023, home game against the Seattle Seahawks. Johnson and Golden Tate became the Lions' first duo to reach 1,000 yards apiece in the same season since Roy Williams and Mike Furrey in 2006. Since Johnson was drafted by the Lions with the second overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, no player had more receiving yards, receiving touchdowns, and 100-yard games (46) than Johnson through the 2015 season. Johnson set a career-high for receptions in a game during the Week-9 match-up against the Lions' division rivals, the Chicago Bears, with eight receptions that garnered 94 yards and one touchdown, but still lost the game 27–23. On October 14, before the Week 6 trade deadline, Roy Williams was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a first, a third and a seventh-round pick in the 2009 NFL draft, making Johnson the Lions' starting wide receiver and the last big threat on the offense. In Week 4 against the Dallas Cowboys, Johnson helped rally the Lions from a 24-point deficit to a 34–30 victory by catching two touchdown passes in the fourth quarter, including a famous catch in which Johnson beat the Cowboys' triple coverage in the end zone. As the official starting wide receiver behind Roy Williams, Johnson led the team in receptions and yards, collecting seven catches for 107 yards, which included one 38-yard catch-and-run in the Lions' 34–21 loss. 2012 season\nOn March 14, 2012, Johnson signed an eight-year extension worth US$132 million with the Detroit Lions, with US$60 million guaranteed, making Johnson the highest-paid receiver in the league. While still regarded as being in his prime, Johnson retired after the 2015 season, citing a loss of passion for the game due to health concerns and the Lions' lack of overall success during his tenure. On August 3, 2007, Johnson signed a six-year deal with the Detroit Lions after holding out for eight days, and passed his physical in time to be on the field for the start of that m"", 'From Pacific Rim National Park Reserve:\nIn 1959, the provincial government opened both the Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park (which was expanded in 1961 and 1968) and Highway 4, from Tofino to Port Alberni. There understory is dominated by moss (like Sphagnum), lichen and ferns (like deer fern and sword ferns). The two bays are connected by a 3 km (1.9 mi) Nuu-chah-nulth Trail and the KWisitis Visitor Centre (formerly Wickaninnish Interpretive Centre). The island beaches vary from shallow sand terrain to exposed weathered rock. Affected by the Kuroshio Current, the sea water temperatures range from 8 °C (46 °F) in January to 14 °C (57 °F) in August. West Coast Trail\nThe West Coast Trail Unit covers 193 km2 (75 sq mi) and features the 75 km (47 mi) hiking trail between Port Renfrew and Bamfield. The park area averages over 3,500 to 4,000 millimetres (140 to 160 in) of precipitation per year. The intertidal zone provides habitat for eelgrass, Aggregating anemone, echinoderms (like the western sand dollar and ochre sea star), sea snails (like the northern abalone), and crabs. The area is predominantly marine with high-relief rock reefs and kelp beds anchored by a rocky substrate. The air temperatures generally range from 5 to 18 °C (41 to 64 °F). For multi-day trips, Parks Canada maintains campgrounds on seven of the islands: Hand, Turret, Gibraltar, Willis, Dodd, Clarke and Gilbert islands. Ecology\nInland ecology\nThe terrestrial portion of the park lies within what the province terms the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone (very wet hypermaritime subzone), based on the climax vegetation. Pacific Rim National Park Reserve is a 511 km2 (197 sq mi) national park located in British Columbia, Canada, which comprises three separate regions: Long Beach, the Broken Group Islands, and the West Coast Trail. Broken Group Islands\nThe Broken Group Islands unit is a 106 km2 (41 sq mi) area in the Barkley Sound with over one hundred small islands. By 1911, it was classified as a public highway with a 20 m (66 ft) right-of-way known as the Life Saving Trail or the Shipwrecked Mariners Trail. Kayaks are most often launched from Toquart Bay to the north, but sometimes from Ucluelet which is 13 km from the first campsite at Clarke Island or from Bamfield which is 15 km from Gibraltar Island. The northern end of the trail, outside of Bamfield, also features a separate 7 km (4.3 mi) trail to Cape Beale with a campsite at Keeha Beach. From there, the Pachena Point Light is 10 km (6.2 mi) in and the first two campsites are at the 12 km and 14 km markers along the trail. Long Beach\nThe 212 km2 (82 sq mi) Long Beach Unit, located along Highway 4 between Tofino to Ucluelet, features several beaches, short trails, and a campground. The Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park formed the nucleus upon which the national park was assembled. In 1930, at the request of the federal government, the provincial government placed a reserve on land in the Nitinat Lake area, and in 1948, the provincial government reserved land that would later become the Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park. While Benson Island had hosted a summer village (and wintered in the area now known as Port Alberni), it had been abandoned; a subsequent village on Effingham burnt down in 1914. After years of negotiation between the federal government and the provincial government of W.A.C. Regardless, in 1947 the Victoria Chamber of Commerce added their voice to advocating park here, in the form of an addition to the Strathcona Provincial Park with land along the Clayoquot Arm to Long Beach.

Sympathetic with the logging interests, the provincial government resisted but it was included in the 1970 agreement with its specific boundaries to be determined. The Wickaninnish Beach Provincial Park was transferred to federal government in 1971 to form the core of the Long Beach Unit and the province purchased or expropriated the private lands around the beach, along with the crown lands of the Broken Group Islands. However, communication and negotiations with federal Minister of Resources Arthur Laing with the provincial Minister of Recreation and Conservation Ken Kiernan and the cabinet of W.A.C. However, the acquisition deadline of 1975 was missed as the two governments and the companies with the timber rights on the provincial crown land, B.C. Over the next several years, the provincial government, forestry companies, and park advocates negotiated and finalized the boundaries, with conservationists advocating for boundaries to include the entire watersheds and federal government advoc', 'From Palomar Mountain:\nHarrison\'s tall tales of the mountain\'s fauna, including his overcoming of countless grizzlies and aggressive mountain lions, and his blithesome, joking disposition, made him locally famous among the county\'s travelers. Palomar Mountain State Park\nPalomar Mountain is the location of Palomar Mountain State Park, a California State Park. The 1977 film The Crater Lake Monster had many scenes filmed on Palomar Mountain, including scenes shot at the summit restaurant, but not the scenes of the monster in a lake. The upper elevations of the Palomar Mountain range have notably different habitats than its lower elevation foothills. Palomar Observatory\nPalomar Mountain is most famous as the home of Palomar Observatory which includes the Hale Telescope. The humid climate supports a forest of oak, pine, fir and cedar on large swaths of the mountain. High Point\nHigh Point, in the Palomar Mountain range, is one of the highest peaks in San Diego County. The Spanish name Palomar, meaning ""pigeon roost"" or “place of the pigeons”, comes from the Spanish colonial era in Alta California when Palomar Mountain was known as the home of band-tailed pigeons. Nathan Harrison, the first African American homesteader in San Diego area, purchased several acres on the western slope of the mountain in the 1880s and graded a road that became a popular tourist route called Harrison\'s grade. History\nThe Luiseño name for Palomar Mountain was Paauw and High Point was called Wikyo. Beginning in the 1920s a fire lookout tower has been present on Boucher Hill on Palomar Mountain. Palomar Mountain ( PAL-ə-mar; Spanish: Monte Palomar [paloˈmaɾ]) is a mountain ridge in the Peninsular Ranges in northern San Diego County, California. It is known as the location of Palomar Observatory and Hale Telescope, and known for Palomar Mountain State Park. Oak Knoll Campground\nAt the base of Palomar Mountain on County Route S6 is Oak Knoll Campground, formerly known as Palomar Gardens. Annual precipitation on the mountain averages 30–35 inches (highly variable from year to year), mostly falling between October and April. Climate\nAccording to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Palomar Mountain has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated ""Csa"" on climate maps. High Point can also be hiked on the Oak Grove Trail,  the oldest established trail on the Palomar Ranger District. The lower regions are in the California montane chaparral and woodlands sub-ecoregion, adapted to the xeric/dry Mediterranean climate with chaparral and woodlands flora. Palomar Mountain, especially in the state park area, is densely wooded with abundant oak and conifer tree species (pine, cedar, fir). The park was among 70 California State Parks threatened by budget cuts in fiscal years 2011-2012 and 2012-2013, but the park and the campgrounds remain open. However, it is not accessible by the public from that direction as the observatory itself and adjacent land are private property, and the road to High Point from the observatory is blocked by a permanently closed gate. The 200-inch telescope was the world\'s largest and most important telescope from 1949 until 1992. The tower opens around May 1 in conjunction with the fire season and closes in early December. The campgrounds in the park were temporarily closed on October 2, 2011, due to state budget cuts. The park averages 70,000 visitors annually. The hike is 13.5 miles roundtrip. The observatory currently has four large telescopes, the most recent one being a 40-in robotic infrared one operational since 2021. According to an article by Daniel Weiss, ""Harrison was briefly married twice, both times to Luiseño Indian women who were part of a community that lived on the mountain,"" and he was baptized into the Catholic faith ""by a Luiseño chief in Rincon who had converted to Catholicism."" The tower had been active until it was abandoned in 1983 and then was reactivated when the San Diego/Riverside County Chapter of the FFLA Forest Fire Lookout Association - San Diego/Riverside Chapter began manning it in 2012. Access\nSouth Grade Road, the stretch of San Diego County Route S6 going from State Route 76 to the summit provides access with over 20 hairpin turns over the distance of less than 7 mi (11 km). Ferns are abundant everywhere in the shady forest. During the 1890s, the population was sufficient to support three public schools, and it was a popular summer resort for Southern California, with three hotels in operation part of the time, and a tent city in Doane Valley each summer. Doane Valley, located within the State Park, is home to the Camp Palomar Outdoor School for 6th grade students in San Diego Unified School District. It was brought back into service in 2009 and is staffed by the San Diego/Riverside County Chapter of the FFLA Forest Fire Lookout Association - San Diego/Riverside.

Lacking a strong central banking system, the government was unable to coordinate a response to the economic downturn. The Oklahoma Enabling Act also contained provisions encouraging New Mexico Territory and Arizona Territory to begin the process of gaining admission as states. In 1906, Congress passed the Antiquities Act, granting the president the power to create national monuments in federal lands. Oklahoma, which was formed out of Indian Territory and Oklahoma Territory, became the 46th state on November 16, 1907. Roosevelt encouraged the Newlands Reclamation Act of 1902, which promoted federal construction of dams to irrigate small farms and placed 230 million acres (360,000 mi2 or 930,000 km2) under federal protection. Roosevelt set aside more federal land, national parks, and nature preserves than all of his predecessors combined. In the aftermath of a series of scandals involving major insurance companies, Roosevelt sought to establish a National Bureau of Insurance to provide federal regulation, but this proposal was also defeated. The Foraker Act and subsequent Supreme Court cases established Puerto Rico as the first unincorporated territory, meaning that the United States Constitution would not fully apply to Puerto Rico. When Hawaii became part of the U.S. in 1898, the Japanese were the largest element of the population then. He also called for a national incorporation law (all corporations had state charters, which varied greatly state by state), a federal income tax and inheritance tax (both targeted at the rich), limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes (injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business), an eight-hour work day for federal employees, a postal savings system (to provide competition for local banks), and legislation barring corporations from contributing to political campaigns. In the late 19th century, the opening of sugar plantations in the Kingdom of Hawaii led to the immigration of large numbers of Japanese families. He dramatically expanded the system of national parks and national forests. It included, in addition to the rapid building of a public school system based on English language teaching:\n\nsteel and concrete wharves at the newly renovated Port of Manila; dredging the River Pasig,; streamlining of the Insular Government; accurate, intelligible accounting; the construction of a telegraph and cable communications network; the establishment of a postal savings bank; large-scale road-and bridge-building; impartial and incorrupt policing; well-financed civil engineering; the conservation of old Spanish architecture; large public parks; a bidding process for the right to build railways; Corporation law; and a coastal and geological survey. He reduced the number of blacks holding federal patronage. Troubles with Japan\nThe American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that otherwise Japan would dominate the Hawaiian Republic. The Agreement said Japan would stop emigration of Japanese laborers to the U.S. or Hawaii, and there would not be segregation in California. Its taxes on imports produced over one-third of federal revenue in 1901. These Republican leaders blocked the more ambitious aspects of Roosevelt\'s agenda, though Roosevelt won passage of a new Federal Employers Liability Act and other laws, such as a restriction of child labor in Washington, D.C.\n\nStates admitted\nOne new state, Oklahoma, was admitted to the Union while Roosevelt was in office. First term\nUpon taking office, Roosevelt proposed new federal regulation of trusts. Roosevelt also won passage of the Elkins Act, which restricted the granting of railroad rebates. While Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, wanted nature preserved for the sake of pure beauty, Roosevelt subscribed to Pinchot\'s formulation, ""to make the forest produce the largest amount of whatever crop or service will be most useful, and keep on producing it for generation after generation of men and trees."" He also favored amending the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, which had failed to prevent the consolidation of railroads. His presidency saw the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act, which established the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food safety, and the Hepburn Act, which increased the regulatory power of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Roosevelt and Cannon agreed to a compromise bill that became the Meat Inspection Act of 1906. Combined with his earlier rhetoric, the suits signaled Roosevelt\'s resolve to strengthen the federal regulation of trusts. Roosevelt then established the National Conservation Commission to take an inventory of the nation\'s natural resources. While Congress had passed the 1890 Sherman Antitrust Act to ma', 'From History of Australia:\nIn May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. Hamstrung by their lack of control of the Senate, a lack of control of the banking system and divisions within their party about how best to deal with the situation, the government was forced to accept solutions that eventually split the party, as it had in 1917. The Australia Act 1986 eliminated the last vestiges of British legal authority at the federal level. The FCT was renamed the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in 1938. The Federal Capital Territory (FCT) was formed from New South Wales in 1911 to provide a location for the proposed new federal capital of Canberra (Melbourne was the seat of government from 1901 to 1927). The Australian government began funding child care with the Child Care Act of 1972, although state, territory and local government were still the main providers of funding. One-third of the shareholders of the first colonial bank (founded in 1817) were women. These included the abolition of the ""marriage bar"" in the Australian public service in 1966, the Arbitration Commission\'s equal pay decisions of 1969 and 1972, the introduction of paid maternity leave in the Australian public service in 1973, and the enactment of the federal Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 and the Affirmative Action Act of 1986. However, the expense of providing infrastructure to small remote communities has seen pressure from federal, state and territory governments to redirect funding towards larger Indigenous communities. By the 2020s, Aboriginal representation in the federal parliament had exceeded the proportion of Aboriginal people in the general population, and Australia had its first Aboriginal leader of a state or territory in 2016, when the Country Liberal Party\'s Adam Giles became Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. In 1962, the Menzies Government\'s Commonwealth Electoral Act gave Indigenous people the right to vote at federal elections. The ""Premier\'s Plan"" finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in bank interest rates and an increase in taxation. Over the period, Menzies and his successors dismantled remaining restrictions on voting rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples culminating in the Menzies Government\'s 1962 Commonwealth Electoral Act, while the Holt Government\'s landmark 1967 Referendum received overwhelming public support for the transfer of responsibility for Aboriginal Affairs to the Federal Government, and the removal of discriminatory provisions regarding the national census from the Australian Constitution. By November 2023, the Reserve Bank of Australia had raised interest rates to 4.35%, a 12-year high. He established a bank, a currency and a hospital. A 1967 referendum changed the Australian constitution to include all Aboriginal Australians in the national census and allow the Federal parliament to legislate on their behalf. The territory of New South Wales claimed by Britain included all of Australia eastward of the meridian of 135° East. The government also passed legislation against racial discrimination and established a Royal Commission into land rights in the Northern Territory, which formed the basis for the Fraser government\'s Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976. In the five-to-ten years to 2020, the number of women in private sector leadership roles, female federal Justices and Judges, and federal parliamentarians have all increased gradually. The Immigration Restriction Act 1901 was one of the first laws passed by the new Australian parliament. As a result, the territory of New South Wales reached its greatest extent, covering the area of the modern state as well as modern Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory. With most of Australia\'s best forces committed to fight against Hitler in the Middle East, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, the US naval base in Hawaii, on 8 December 1941 (eastern Australia time). Potts himself though suggested a peak national figure of 25 per cent unemployed. The national cabinet announced restrictions on non-essential business, travel and gatherings of people. Labor supported the Reid government of New South Wales in passing the Coloured Races Restriction and Regulation Act, a forerunner of the White Australia Policy. In an effort to isolate Australia, the Japanese planned a seaborne invasion of Port Moresby, in the Australian Territory of New Guinea. The number of Aboriginal people deemed to be wards of the state under Northern Territory welfare laws doubled to 11,000 from 1950 to 1965. The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the Commonwealth in 1911. One of the first acts of the Whitlam government was to establish a Royal Commission into land rights in the Northern Territory under Justice Woodward. The size of t', 'From Amy Carlson (religious leader):\nThe group briefly moved to the Hawaiian island of Kauai in August 2020, where they were met with hostility from locals after Carlson publicly proclaimed that she was the Hawaiian volcano goddess Pele. Lamboy reportedly emptied the group\'s bank account, which contained $330,000. A multi-day protest ensued, with protestors lighting driftwood fires and chanting Hawaiian prayers around the rented property the group were staying in. Though the house and the group\'s bank accounts were in Lamboy\'s name, he was not charged in connection with the corpse. Amy Carlson (November 30, 1975 – c. April 16, 2021), also known by her followers as Mother God, was an American religious leader and the co-founder of the new religious movement Love Has Won. Carlson and her followers believed that she was God, a 19-billion-year-old being, and a reincarnation of Jesus Christ, and that she could heal people of cancer ""with the power of love."" Her group has been described as a cult by many, including ex-members and media outlets. Carlson\'s body was found mummified in Love Has Won\'s compound in Crestone, Colorado, in April 2021. Early life\nCarlson was born on November 30, 1975, in McPherson, Kansas. Her parents divorced when she was a child, and after they both remarried, Carlson was raised between their homes in Kansas and Oklahoma City. Carlson and her sister Tara left to live with her mother and stepfather after claims of abuse by their stepmother. The family later lived a middle-class life in Dallas, Texas, where Carlson received good grades and sang in the school choir. They later relocated to Houston. Carlson had three children by three different fathers. She worked as a manager at McDonald\'s. During the mid-2000s, Carlson developed an interest in New Age philosophy, and became a regular poster on the forums of the website lightworkers.org. On the forum, she met Amerith WhiteEagle, who convinced Carlson that she was divine, and Carlson began to claim to experience paranormal phenomena; specifically, she heard a voice telling her she would one day become President of the United States. In late 2007, Carlson left her third husband, her children, and her job, and ceased contact with most members of her family. She then joined up with WhiteEagle in Colorado. The group was originally known under the name ""Galactic Federation of Light"". The group posted their first videos to YouTube in 2009. Carlson and WhiteEagle led the group as Mother and Father God. Love Has Won\nCarlson left WhiteEagle around 2014 after gaining her first follower, Miguel Lamboy. Miguel managed the group\'s logistics and finances. The movement began to grow from 2014 onwards, mainly by the internet. The group travelled between Colorado, Oregon, California and Florida prior to 2018, before moving to Moffat, Colorado. There was a succession of ""Father Gods"", with Jason Castillo becoming the final ""Father God"" in 2018. Video footage provided to The Denver Post by Love Has Won member Lauryn Suarez showed eggs and rocks being thrown at the house, as well as the broken windows of the house and the SUV parked in the driveway. The mayor of Kauai, Derek Kawakami, intervened to negotiate the departure of the group from the island. They subsequently flew to Kahului Airport on Maui, and were convinced to return to Colorado in September 2020. Just before Carlson\'s death in April 2021, Lamboy paid the Colorado Secretary of State\'s office $50 to register a new nonprofit, Gaia\'s Crystal Schools Inc., listing the associated address as 4 Alcedo Court, where authorities recovered Carlson\'s body. Carlson\'s followers claimed that, rather than dying, she had ""ascended"" to the fifth dimension after assuming all of mankind\'s pain. The website lovehaswon.org was taken offline. Several core members of Love Has Won still believe that Amy Carlson is God and reject what they refer to as the ""3D world"". The group renamed their Facebook page and YouTube channel to ""5D Full Disclosure"", and launched a new website, 5dfulldisclosure.org. In the aftermath of Carlson\'s death, the group splintered, with Castillo forming the separate group Joy Rains with a small number of followers. Mother God and beliefs\nCarlson\'s teachings revolved around the idea that she was the 534th incarnation of Mother God, a deity who was destined to lead exactly 144,000 believers out of the superficial reality of the ""3-D world"" and into a fifth-dimensional plane of higher existence. She claimed to have been Mother Earth, Gaia, Cleopatra, Jesus Christ, Joan of Arc, Harriet Tubman, Helena Blavatsky, and Marilyn Monroe; she claimed to have full memory of her past lives, including the crucifixion of Jesus. She also said she could ""produce miracles, kind of like Jesus."" She also claimed to be the mother of Elvis Presley. To accomplish her goals, she needed to regularly commune with ""The Galactics,"" an ""etheric team"" of spiritual ambassadors that she said was largely made up of deceased celebrities including Robin Williams, Patrick ', 'From Hawaii:\nThis relationship ensures the longevity, sustainability, and natural cycles of growth and decay, as well as cultivating a sense of respect for the land and humility towards one\'s place in an ecosystem. Journals written by Captain Cook\'s crew record that many aliʻi (hereditary nobles) also engaged in aikāne relationships, and Kamehameha the Great, the founder and first ruler of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was also known to participate. Hawaiian mythology\nHawaiian mythology includes the legends, historical tales, and sayings of the ancient Hawaiian people. Hawaiian\nThe Hawaiian language has about 2,000 native speakers, about 0.15% of the total population. These Polynesians remained in the islands; they eventually became the Hawaiian people and their languages evolved into the Hawaiian language. Hawaiian exports include food and clothing. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are re-enactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Later, state programs promoted Hawaiian culture. With the help of the Office of Hawaiian Affairs, specially designated immersion schools in which all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian were established. Hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowel sounds. The keyboard layout used for Hawaiian is QWERTY. Geography and environment\nThere are eight main Hawaiian islands. Hawaiian Journal of History (1973), vol. Nearly 100 years later, in 1993, 17,000 Hawaiians marched to demand access and control over Hawaiian trust lands and as part of the modern Hawaiian sovereignty movement. However, the use of Hawaiian is limited because the constitution specifies that ""Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions only as provided by law"". According to Hawaiian scholar Haunani-Kay Trask, tourism in Hawaii has led to the commodification and exploitation of Hawaiian culture resulting in insidious forms of ""cultural prostitution"". Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the Austronesian language family. Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. List of state parks\nThere are many Hawaiian state parks. Opponents to the tribal approach argue it is not a legitimate path to Hawaiian nationhood; they also argue that the U.S. government should not be involved in re-establishing Hawaiian sovereignty. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic. This later immigration is detailed in Hawaiian mythology (moʻolelo) about Paʻao. The Hawaiian language uses the glottal stop (ʻOkina) as a consonant. Homosexual relationships known as aikāne were widespread and normal in ancient Hawaiian society. The exact spelling of the state\'s name in the Hawaiian language is Hawaiʻi. Hawaiian sugarcane plantation owners began to recruit experienced, unemployed laborers in Puerto Rico. The ʻokina and kahakō are intended to capture the proper pronunciation of Hawaiian words. For example, tuna fish is often called by its Hawaiian name, ahi. Hawaiian magazines include Hana Hou!, Hawaii Business and Honolulu, among others. Traditional Hawaiian folk music is a major part of the state\'s musical heritage. The pro-federal recognition Akaka Bill drew substantial opposition among Hawaiian residents in the 2000s. Hawaiian music has had an enormous impact on the music of other Polynesian islands; according to Peter Manuel, the influence of Hawaiian music is a ""unifying factor in the development of modern Pacific musics"". Hawaiian trust land ownership and use is still widely contested as a consequence of annexation. The unmixed indigenous Hawaiian population has still not restored itself to its 300,000 pre-contact level. Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments. These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands, causing the Hawaiian population to drop precipitously. Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants and animals. Native Hawaiian musician and Hawaiian sovereignty activist Israel Kamakawiwoʻole, famous for his medley of ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"", was named ""The Voice of Hawaii"" by NPR in 2010 in its 50 great voices series. Topography\nThe Hawaiian archipelago is 2,000 mi (3,200 km) southwest of the contiguous United States. Tourism\nTourism is an important part of the Hawaiian economy as it represents ¼ of the economy. The date of the human discovery and habitation of the Hawaiian Islands is the subject of academic debate. The Hawaiian people have inhabited the islands for centuries and have retained much of their traditional musical knowledge. Other notable Hawaiian Martial Artists include Travis Browne, K. J. Noons, Brad Tavares and Wesley Correira. In 2005, Kamehameha enrolled 5,398 students, 8.4% of the Native Hawaiian children in the state.

(Anderson 2001, chronology; Marquardt & Walters 1994, p. xxx). November 2: The Kirtland Safety Society, also known as The Kirtland Bank, is formed for use by church members in financial affairs. In the late 1820s, Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, announced that an angel had given him a set of golden plates engraved with a chronicle of ancient American peoples, which he had a unique gift to translate. 1837\nJanuary 2: Having failed to receive a charter, due to political attitudes against Mormons and banking in general, the church\'s bank is reestablished as the Kirtland Safety Society Anti-Banking Company, a joint-stock association. Late December: Many people are excommunicated from the church for various reasons, including Martin Harris, one of the Three Witnesses, because he supported a movement to reform and reorganize the church over the Kirtland bank failure. after May: Joseph Smith Sr. has his second vision, in which he saw a barren field representing the desolate world, a ""narrow path"", a stream with a rope running along its bank leading to a beautiful tree bearing a fruit whiter than snow that was ""delicious beyond description. In 1830, he published the resulting narratives as the Book of Mormon and founded the Church of Christ in western New York, claiming it to be a restoration of early Christianity. Moving the church to Kirtland, Ohio in 1831, Joseph Smith attracted hundreds of converts, who were called Latter Day Saints. He sent some to Jackson County, Missouri to establish a city of Zion. In 1833, Missouri settlers expelled the Saints from Zion, and Smith\'s paramilitary expedition to recover the land was unsuccessful. Fleeing an arrest warrant in the aftermath of a Kirtland financial crisis, Smith joined his remaining followers in Far West, Missouri, but tensions escalated into violent conflicts with the old Missouri settlers. Believing the Saints to be in insurrection, the Missouri governor ordered their expulsion from Missouri, and Smith was imprisoned on capital charges. After escaping state custody in 1839, Smith directed the conversion of a swampland into Nauvoo, Illinois, where he became both mayor and commander of a nearly autonomous militia. In 1843, he announced his candidacy for President of the United States. The following year, after the Nauvoo Expositor criticized his power and such new doctrines as plural marriage, Smith and the Nauvoo city council ordered the newspaper\'s destruction as a nuisance. In a futile attempt to check public outrage, Smith first declared martial law, then surrendered to the governor of Illinois. He was killed by a mob while awaiting trial in Carthage, Illinois. After the death of the Smiths, a succession crisis occurred in the Latter Day Saint movement. Hyrum Smith, the Assistant President of the Church, was intended to succeed Joseph as President of the Church, but because he was killed with his brother, the proper succession procedure became unclear. Initially, the primary contenders to succeed Joseph Smith were Brigham Young, Sidney Rigdon, and James Strang. Young, president of the Quorum of the Twelve, claimed authority was handed by Smith to the Quorum of the Twelve. Rigdon was the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, a body that led the church since 1832. At the time of the Smiths\' deaths, Rigdon was estranged from Smith due to differences in doctrinal beliefs. Strang claimed that Smith designated him as the successor in a letter that was received by Strang a week before Smith\'s death. Later, others came to believe that Smith\'s son, Joseph Smith III, was the rightful successor under the doctrine of Lineal succession. Several schisms resulted, with each claimant attracting followers. The majority of Latter Day Saints followed Young; these adherents later emigrated to Utah Territory and continued as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Rigdon\'s followers were known as Rigdonites, some of which later established The Church of Jesus Christ. Strang\'s followers established the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite). In the 1860s, those who felt that Smith should have been succeeded by Joseph Smith III established the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which later changed its name to Community of Christ. Under Brigham Young, the LDS Church orchestrated a massive overland migration of Latter-day Saint pioneers to Utah, by wagon train and, briefly, by handcart.

gemini-pro,Which film featuring a solar eclipse in its opening scene is adapted from the same source material as a David Lynch movie?,"['Which film featuring a solar eclipse in its opening scene is adapted from the same source material as a David Lynch movie?', 'From Pinhole camera:\nYour Guide to the 2017 Total Solar Eclipse. ""Solar eclipse observation: some simple devices"". ""Creation of Pinhole Camera for Solar Eclipse Using STEM Education"". During an eclipse, this produces small crescents in the case of a partial eclipse, or hollow rings in the case of an annular eclipse. The photographic camera, as developed early in the 19th century, was basically an adaptation of the box-type camera obscura with a lens. The infinite depth of field means that image blur depends not on object distance but on other factors, such as the distance from the aperture to the film plane, the aperture size, the wavelength(s) of the light source, and motion of the subject or canvas. ""Projects for Observing the Sun (And the Eclipse)"". Pinhole cameras can be constructed with a sliding film holder or back to adjust the distance between the film and the pinhole. Over the centuries others started to experiment with it, mainly in dark rooms with a small opening in shutters, mostly to study the nature of light and to safely watch solar eclipses. Usage\nThe image of a pinhole camera may be projected onto a translucent screen for a real-time viewing (used for safe observation of solar eclipses) or to trace the image on paper. In 1893 the Kinetoscope was finally introduced with moving pictures on celluloid film strips. Moving the film closer to the pinhole will result in a wide angle field of view and shorter exposure time. Moving the film farther away from the pinhole will result in a telephoto or narrow-angle view and longer exposure time. Instructions for building a pinhole camera were published by Kodak, using either a 126 film cartridge or an empty can. But it is more often used without a translucent screen for pinhole photography with photographic film or photographic paper placed on the surface opposite to the pinhole aperture. Suitable containers include empty cylindrical cans, with one open end having a removable lid to facilitate loading film, and the other (closed) end equipped with the pinhole. As a result of the enormous increase in f-number, to maintain similar exposure times, the photographer must use a fast film in direct sunshine or other bright light conditions. In its simplest form, a pinhole camera includes a light-tight box with a pinhole in one end, and a piece of film or other light-sensitive material at the other end. In particular, compact 35 mm cameras whose lens and focusing assembly have been damaged can be reused as pinhole cameras, maintaining the use of the shutter and film winding mechanisms. Exposures projected on to modern light-sensitive photographic film can typically range from five seconds up to as much as several hours, with smaller pinholes requiring longer exposures to produce the same size image. Once exposure time has exceeded about 1 second for film or 30 seconds for paper, one must compensate for the breakdown in linear response of the film/paper to intensity of illumination by using longer exposures. That is, the actual focal length f (the distance between the pinhole and the film plane) is equal to \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              s\n              \n                2\n              \n            \n            λ\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle {\\frac {s^{2}}{\\lambda }}}\n  \n. Film and integral photography experiments\nAccording to inventor William Kennedy Dickson, the first experiments directed at moving pictures by Thomas Edison and his researchers took place around 1887 and involved ""microscopic pin-point photographs, placed on a cylindrical shell"". A pinhole camera is a simple camera without a lens but with a tiny aperture (the so-called pinhole)—effectively a light-proof box with a small hole in one side. Light from a scene passes through the aperture and projects an inverted image on the opposite side of the box, which is known as the camera obscura  effect. The size of the images depends on the distance between the object and the pinhole. A Worldwide Pinhole Photography Day is observed on the last Sunday of April, every year. History\nCamera obscura\nThe camera obscura or pinhole image is a natural optical phenomenon. Early known descriptions are found in the Chinese Mozi writings (circa 500 BCE) and the Aristotelian Problems (circa 300 BCE – 600 CE). Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039), an Arab physicist also known as Alhazen, described the camera obscura effect. Giambattista Della Porta wrote in 1558 in his Magia Naturalis about using a concave mirror to project the image onto paper and to use this as a drawing aid. However, at about the same time, the use of a lens instead of a pinhole was introduced. In the 17th century, the camera obscura with a lens became a popular drawing aid that was further developed into a mobile device, first in a little tent and later in a box. The term ""pin-hole"" in the context of optics was found in James Ferguson\'s 1764 book Lectures on select subjects in mechanics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and optics. Ear', 'From Mongkut:\nMongkut is known in the West primarily through the lens of the 1951 musical The King and I and its 1956 film adaptation. One way that he honed his mastery of astronomy, aside from the accurate prediction of the solar eclipse of 18 August 1868 (Wakor solar eclipse), was changing the official Buddhist calendar, ""which was seriously miscalculated and the times for auspicious moments were incorrect."" In 1868, he invited high-ranking European and Siamese officials to accompany him to Wakor village in Prachuap Khiri Khan Province, south of Hua Hin, where the solar eclipse that was to occur on 18 August could be best viewed as a total eclipse. King Mongkut predicted the solar eclipse, at (in his own words) ""East Greenwich longitude 99 degrees 42\' and latitude North 11 degrees 39\'."" Death and legacy\nThe solar eclipse at Wakor\nDuring his monkhood, Mongkut studied both indigenous astrology and English texts on Western astronomy and mathematics, hence developing his skills in astronomical measurement. When he made calculations on the Wakor solar eclipse that was to occur, he used the Thai system of measuring time (""mong"" and ""baht""), but he implemented the Western method of longitude and latitude when he determined where on Earth the eclipse would best be viewed. Her story would become the inspiration for the Hollywood movies Anna and the King of Siam and Anna and the King as well as the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical The King and I and its subsequent film adaptation, which, because of their fictionalized historical references and perceived disrespectful treatment of King Mongkut, were initially banned in Thailand as the Thai government and people considered them to be lèse majesté. The Royal Storage had been the source of Ayutthaya\'s prosperity as it collected immense taxation on foreign traders, including the taxation according to the width of the galleon and the tithe. Mongkut  (18 October 1804 – 1 October 1868) was the fourth king of Siam from the Chakri dynasty, titled Rama IV. He reigned from 1851 until his death in 1868. The reign of Mongkut was marked by significant modernization initiatives and diplomatic engagements, which played pivotal roles in shaping Thailand\'s trajectory towards progress and international relations. Siam first felt the pressure of Western expansionism during Mongkut\'s reign. Mongkut embraced Western innovations and initiated the modernization of his country, both in technology and culture—earning him the nickname ""The Father of Science and Technology"" in Siam. Mongkut was also known for appointing his younger brother, Prince Chutamani, as Second King, crowned in 1851 as King Pinklao. Mongkut told the country that Pinklao should be respected with equal honor to himself (as King Naresuan had done with his brother Ekathotsarot in 1583). During Mongkut\'s reign, the power of the House of Bunnag reached its zenith: It became the most powerful noble family of Siam. Early life\nMongkut (มงกุฎ, literal meaning: crown) was the second son of Prince Itsarasunthon, son of Phutthayotfa Chulalok, the first Chakri king of Siam (King Rama I) and Princess Bunrot. Mongkut was born in the Old (Thonburi) Palace in 1804, where the first son had died shortly after birth in 1801. He was followed by Prince Chutamani (เจ้าฟ้าจุฑามณี) in 1808. In 1809, Prince Itsarasunthon was crowned as Phutthaloetla Naphalai (later styled King Rama II.) The royal family then moved to the Grand Palace. Thenceforth, until their own accessions as kings, the brothers (เจ้าฟ้า chaofa) were called Chao Fa Yai (เจ้าฟ้าใหญ่) and Chao Fa Noi (เจ้าฟ้าน้อย). :\u200a151\n\nMonastic life and Dhammayut sect\nIn 1824, Mongkut became a Buddhist monk (ordination name Vajirayan; Pali Vajirañāṇo), following a Siamese tradition that men aged 20 should become monks for a time. The same year, his father died. By tradition, Mongkut should have been crowned the next king, but the nobility instead chose the older, more influential and experienced Prince Chetsadabodin (Nangklao), son of a royal concubine rather than a queen. Perceiving the throne was irredeemable and to avoid political intrigues, Mongkut retained his monastic status. Vajirayan became one of the few members of the royal family who devoted his life to religion. He travelled around the country as a monk and saw the relaxation of the rules of the Pali Canon among the Siamese monks he met, which he considered inappropriate. In 1829, at Phetchaburi, he met a monk named Buddhawangso, who strictly followed the monastic rules of discipline, the vinaya. Vajirayan admired Buddhawangso for his obedience to the vinaya, and was inspired to pursue religious reforms. In 1835, he began a reform movement reinforcing the vinaya law that evolved into the Dhammayuttika Nikaya, or Dhammayut sect. A strong theme in Mongkut\'s movement was that, ""…true Buddhism was supposed to refrain from worldly matters and confine itself to spiritual and moral affairs"". Mongkut eventually came to power in 1851, as did his colleagues', 'From Dune (2021 film):\nThe website\'s consensus reads: ""Dune occasionally struggles with its unwieldy source material, but those issues are largely overshadowed by the scope and ambition of this visually thrilling adaptation."" Its writing and scope continued to be praised following its release, while others criticized the runtime, pacing, and adaptation of the source material. The film is the third adaptation of Dune, following David Lynch\'s 1984 film and John Harrison\'s 2000 television miniseries. Production\nBackground\nFollowing the publication of Frank Herbert\'s novel Dune in 1965, it was considered as having potential for a possible film adaptation. Since 1971, various producers have held film adaptation rights for the novel. After an unsuccessful attempt by Paramount Pictures to produce a new adaptation, Legendary Pictures acquired the Dune film and television rights in 2016, with Villeneuve signing on as director in February 2017. Doru Pop discussed the controversies and changes made in the adaptation of Dune to film and Isaac Asimov\'s Foundation to a television series, particularly the gender and racial changes to key characters. Sequels and spin-offs\nVilleneuve intended to make a two-part adaptation of the novel, and by November 2019, Jon Spaihts left his position as showrunner on Dune: Prophecy to focus on writing the sequel film. Development\nIn 2011, Mary Parent, vice chair of worldwide production for Legendary Pictures, and her producer partner Cale Boyter, acquired adaptation rights for Dune. However, while she felt Villeneuve had attempted to be faithful to the source material, she also opined that Villeneuve was trying to satisfy the demands of the contemporary film industry. Similarly, Aaron Couch from The Hollywood Reporter also praised the cast and thought the film was an ""ambitious sci-fi adaptation"". Prospects to make a successful adaptation of Dune improved after the critical and commercial success of the film series adaptations of The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, both of which maintained most of the works\' key characters and plots while managing the limited running time. In 2008, Paramount Pictures hired Peter Berg to direct an adaptation. It is the first of a two-part adaptation of the 1965 novel by Frank Herbert. Frank Jacob found that the film has a stronger Orientalization of the Fremen than Lynch\'s film adaptation, shown through elements such as Chani appearing like the Afghan Girl on the cover of National Geographic in 1985. Analysis\nKara Kennedy concluded that some parts are very faithful to the source material while others are heavily adjusted, such as the opening of the story and the portrayal of the Harkonnen. Legendary obtained film and TV rights for Dune in November 2016. Attempts to make an adaptation based on the book were considered to be ""unfilmable"" due to its breadth of content. Villeneuve expressed interest in making a third film based on Dune Messiah, the second novel in the series, adding that the possibility for the film depended on the success of Dune: Part Two. Alejandro Jodorowsky acquired the rights in the 1970s to make a fourteen-hour adaptation of the book, but the project ultimately failed to secure sufficient funds. This development effort became the subject of the documentary film Jodorowsky\'s Dune (2013). Dune had its world premiere at the 78th Venice International Film Festival on September 3, 2021. He secured a two-movie deal with Warner Bros. Pictures, in the same style as the two-part adaptation of Stephen King\'s It in 2017 and in 2019. His enthusiasm to direct a Dune film earned Parent\'s respect, with Parent hiring Villeneuve after hearing him describe his vision for the film. Dune (titled on-screen as Dune: Part One) is a 2021 American epic science fiction film directed and co-produced by Denis Villeneuve, who co-wrote the screenplay with Jon Spaihts, and Eric Roth. Three soundtrack albums were released for the film by WaterTower Music, including The Dune Sketchbook (Music from the Soundtrack), Dune (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack), and The Art and Soul of Dune on September 3, September 17, and October 22, 2021, respectively. An artbook, The Art and Soul of Dune, was released alongside the film on October 22, 2021. Following the film\'s success, Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures officially greenlit Dune: Part Two in October 2021. In August 2023, Villeneuve declared his intentions for the film to serve as the conclusion of his Dune trilogy. It was well received by critics and audiences with praise for Villeneuve\'s direction, screenplay, the performances of the cast, production values, costumes, Hans Zimmer\'s musical score, visual effects, cinematography, and retaining core elements from the source material. Ahead of Dune: Part Two\'s release, Hans Zimmer revealed he was already writing music for a third film. He was not intimidated by previous film adaptations as he felt his love for Dune allowed him to focus on his own vision. Plot\nIn the distant future, Duke Let', 'From Dune (novel):\nDune was cited as a source of inspiration for Hayao Miyazaki\'s anime film Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1984) for its post-apocalyptic world. A second film adaptation, directed by Denis Villeneuve, was released on October 21, 2021, to positive reviews. In 1984, a film adaptation directed by David Lynch was released to mostly negative responses from critics and failure at the box office, although it later developed a cult following. A 2013 documentary, Jodorowsky\'s Dune, was made about Jodorowsky\'s failed attempt at an adaptation. After a long period of hardship and exile, he confronts and defeats the source of evil in his tale. Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. The most important game adaptation is Dune II (1992), which established the conventions of modern real-time strategy games and is considered to be among the most influential video games of all time. 1984 film by David Lynch\nIn 1981, the nine-year film rights were set to expire. Villeneuve explained in March 2018 that his adaptation will be split into two films, with the first installment scheduled to begin production in 2019. Films by Denis Villeneuve\nIn November 2016, Legendary Entertainment acquired the film and TV rights for Dune. The producers stated that they were going for a ""faithful adaptation"" of the novel and considered ""its theme of finite ecological resources particularly timely"". Moebius began designing creatures and characters for the film, while Foss was brought in to design the film\'s space ships and hardware. This first film of Dune, directed by Lynch, was released in 1984, nearly 20 years after the book\'s publication. The film went on to be nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning six, the most wins of the night for any film in contention. Further film attempts\nIn 2008, Paramount Pictures announced that they would produce a new film based on the book, with Peter Berg attached to direct. Adaptations\nDune has been considered an ""unfilmable"" and ""uncontainable"" work to adapt from novel to film or other visual medium. While the planet is an inhospitable and sparsely populated desert wasteland, it is the only source of melange, or ""spice"", a drug that extends life and enhances mental abilities. The film received ""generally favorable reviews"" on Metacritic. Early stalled attempts\nIn 1971, the production company Apjac International (APJ) (headed by Arthur P. Jacobs) optioned the rights to film Dune. Warner Bros. Pictures distributed the film, which had its initial premiere on September 3, 2021, at the Venice Film Festival, and wide release in both theaters and streaming on HBO Max on October 21, 2021, as part of Warner Bros.\'s approach to handling the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. In the 1970s, cult filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky attempted to make a film based on the novel. Although Arrakis is a harsh and inhospitable desert planet, it is of enormous importance because it is the only planetary source of melange, or the ""spice"", a unique and incredibly valuable substance that extends human youth, vitality and lifespan. Lynch ended up producing a nearly three-hour long film, but at demands from Universal Pictures, the film\'s distributor, he cut it back to about two hours, hastily filming additional scenes to make up for some of the cut footage. Production of the work was troubled by problems at the Mexican studio and hampering the film\'s timeline. According to Giger, Dalí was ""later invited to leave the film because of his pro-Franco statements"". In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights from APJ, with Alejandro Jodorowsky set to direct. It received critical acclaim  especially for its visual effects and has grossed over $711 million worldwide, making it the fourth-highest-grossing film of 2024. Subsequently, with a script draft by Joshua Zetumer, Paramount reportedly sought a new director who could do the film for under $175 million. Though Herbert said the book\'s depth and symbolism seemed to intimidate many filmmakers, he was pleased with the film, saying that ""They\'ve got it. It was at first proposed to score the film with original music by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Henry Cow, and Magma; later on, the soundtrack was to be provided by Pink Floyd. He worked on three drafts of the script, using The Battle of Algiers as a point of reference, before moving on to direct another science fiction film, Blade Runner (1982). Reviews of the film were negative, saying that it was incomprehensible to those unfamiliar with the book, and that fans would be disappointed by the way it strayed from the book\'s plot. Lynch was extremely displeased with this move, and demanded that Universal replace his name on these cuts with the pseudonym ""Alan Smithee"", and has generally distanced himself from the film since. It has gone on to win multiple awards and was named by the National Board of Revi', ""From Summit Entertainment:\nIn June 2010 Summit released the third film of the Twilight series, The Twilight Saga: Eclipse. In 2006, it became an independent film studio with over a billion dollars in financing backed by Merrill Lynch. History\nIndependent era (1991–2012)\nSummit Entertainment was founded in 1991 as The Summit Group by film producers Bernd Eichinger (Constantin Film), Arnon Milchan (Regency Enterprises), and Andrew G. Vajna (Carolco Pictures and Cinergi) to handle film sales in foreign countries. Other Summit Entertainment releases include: Ender's Game (released November 1, 2013 in the United States; an adaptation of Orson Scott Card's 1985 novel); Next Day Air ($10,027,047 US box office); The Hurt Locker ($16,400,000 US box office; it garnered Summit its first Best Picture Oscar); the animated Astro Boy; teen horror film Sorority Row ($11,965,282 US box office); the low-budget Push ($31,811,527 US box office); Bandslam ($5,210,988 US box office); Letters to Juliet ($53,032,453 US box office); and, the sleeper hit, RED ($87,940,198 US box office; nominated for a 2010 Golden Globe in the Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical category). Summit Entertainment, LLC  (formerly The Summit Group) is an American film production label of Lionsgate Films, owned by Lionsgate Studios and is headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Summit officially launched in 1993 by David Garrett, Patrick Wachsberger, and Bob Hayward under the name Summit Entertainment LP as a distribution and sales organization. By 1995 they were producing and co-financing films, and by 1997 they started fully financing films. Among the company's early successes was American Pie, which Summit distributed outside of English-speaking territories. In 1998, Summit acquired worldwide distribution rights to the entire filmography of Wim Wenders, including the then-upcoming Buena Vista Social Club, from Road Movies Filmproduktion; the deal however excluded The End of Violence, retained by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Ciby 2000. Starting in 2007, Summit Entertainment's home video division was distributed by Universal Studios Home Entertainment. After a string of flops including P2, Never Back Down and Sex Drive, Summit found success in November 2008 with the release of Twilight, a teen romance about vampires based on the best-selling book of the same name by Stephenie Meyer that made $408,773,703 worldwide. In the spring of 2009, Summit released Knowing, the company's second movie to open #1 at the box office and made $182,492,056 worldwide. In November 2009, Summit released the sequel to Twilight titled The Twilight Saga: New Moon, also based on the popular novel by Stephenie Meyer, breaking box office records for first weekend grosses at the time, taking in $142,839,137 in the first three days. It broke a midnight screening record of over $30 million and set a one-day Wednesday record of $68.5 million. It became the first movie in the series to cross the $300 million mark domestically. In 2008, Summit Entertainment ranked in eighth place among the studios, with a gross of $226.5 million, almost entirely because of the release of Twilight. In 2009, Summit ranked 7th among studios with a gross of $482.5 million. Lionsgate era (2012–present)\nOn February 1, 2009, it was announced that Lionsgate would acquire Summit Entertainment, along with its library of six films and rights to the Twilight franchise, but two days later, these merger negotiations broke down due to concerns over changing content. On January 13, 2012, Lionsgate officially acquired Summit Entertainment for $412.5 million. Lionsgate continues to operate Summit Entertainment as a label.

The natural history branch of the former National Museum of Canada became the National Museum of Natural Sciences (later renamed the Canadian Museum of Nature), while the science and technology branch became the National Museum of Science and Technology (later renamed the Canada Science and Technology Museum). Collections\nAs of June 2021, the Canadian Museum of History\'s permanent collection includes more than three million artifacts, documents, works of art, and other specimens. The National Museums of Canada Corporation was formed by the federal government in order to manage these national museums, in addition to the National Gallery of Canada. Museum of anthropology and history (1968–present)\nOn 1 April 1968, the branches of the National Museum of Canada were formally split into separate museums. ""Museums, Nation and Political History in the Australian National Museum and the Canadian Museum of Civilization"". The Canadian Museum of History (French: Musée canadien de l’histoire) is a national museum on anthropology, Canadian history, cultural studies, and ethnology in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. Although the institutions were split, the National Museum of Man and the National Museum of Natural History continued to share the Victoria Memorial building; with the National Museum of Man occupying the western half of the building. History\nEarly museum (1856–1968)\nThe Canadian Museum of History originates from the collecting efforts of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), an organization established in 1842 in Montreal. The gallery aimed to promote Canadian multiculturalism, having portrayed a social history that depicted a ""march of immigrants"" from east to west, and the success of different groups in Canada. A World Inside: A 150-year History of the Canadian Museum of Civilization. The museum\'s permanent collection dates back to the collection established by the Geological Survey of Canada in the 1860s. ""Branding History at the Canadian Museum of Civilization"". The Act also changed the institution\'s name from the Canadian Museum of Civilization to the  Canadian Museum of History. In July 1999, the museum entered an agreement with the Canadian Nursing Association (CNA), the Canadian War Museum, and the National Archives of Canada to create the Canadian Nursing History Collection. In 2021, the Canadian Museum of History entered into an agreement to house and maintain artifacts from Canada\'s Sports Hall of Fame. In 1927, the museum division of the Department of Mines was renamed the National Museum of Canada. The corporation also administers the Virtual Museum of New France, a virtual museum and online exhibition of the Canadian Museum of History; and the Virtual Museum of Canada, an administrative program that supports the development of online projects for museums and heritage organizations across Canada. In 1990, the Museum Act was passed by the federal government, replacing the defunct National Museums of Canada Corporation and forming several new entities to manage the national museums of Canada; with the Canadian Museum of Civilization corporation formed on 1 July 1990 to manage the Canadian Museum of Civilization, and the Canadian War Museum. The national museum was later split into several separate institutions in 1968, with the anthropology and human history departments forming the National Museum of Man. The Canadian Museum of History opened a permanent exhibition for the collection in 2014 in partnership with Canada Post. Management\nThe Canadian Museum of History is managed by a federal Crown corporation of the same name under the Department of Canadian Heritage\'s portfolio. The Canadian Postal Museum, a department of the Canadian Museum of Civilization corporation that operated from within the institution was shut down in 2012 as a result of the museum\'s transition into the Canadian Museum of History. In 2013, the museum adopted its current name, the Canadian Museum of History, and modified its mandate to emphasize Canadian identity and history. Some have criticized the new mandate and updating of Canada Hall as a part of a wider plan by the incumbent Conservative government to redirect public historical understanding to emphasize aspects of Canadian military history and monarchism; as well as elide problematic elements of Canadian history in favour of achievements. The following year in June 1981, the cabinet of Canada approved several plans concerning several national museums of Canada, including moving the National Museum of Man into a new structure. Approximately 950 documented artifacts from this collection are deposited at the Canadian Museum of History. In December 2013, the Canadian Museum of History Act received Royal Assent, which shifted the museum\'s mandate from developing a collection with a ""special but not exclusive reference to Canada,"" to one th', 'From Canadian War Museum:\nThe Transfer of the War Art Collections from the National Gallery of Canada to the Canadian War Museum"".

War Art in Canada: A Critical History. This led to an increase in the museum\'s research capacity and towards the establishment of the Centre of Military History. The museum has been invested in several Canadian war art programs since 1971, after the National Gallery of Canada handed over management of the Canadian War Memorial Fund, and over 5,000 works from its Canadian War Records Collections to the war museum; including all of its war art from the Second World War. In 1990, the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation (later renamed the Canadian Museum of History Corporation) was formed through The Museum Act, and assumed management of several national museums of Canada, including the war museum. After the closure of the Public Archive\'s history museum in 1967, materials and documents from the museum were split between the National Museum of Man (now the Canadian Museum of History), and the Canadian War Museum.

The museum was operated by the Public Archives of Canada until 1967, when the National Museums of Canada Corporation was formed to manage several national institutions, including the war museum. The galleries were intended to ""enhance the human experiences of war,"" documenting moments in Canadian military history that helped shape the country; with many of the exhibits drawing links to the events with larger themes of nationhood and national identity.

In 1983 the museum relocated its storage facilities from the War Trophies building to Vimy House; with the former building demolished to make way for the National Gallery of Canada\'s new building. History\nBackground\nThe collections of the Canadian War Museum originated from the collections of the Cartier Square Military Museum, established through a general order on 5 November 1880. In addition to its permanent exhibition, the museum has hosted and organized a number of travelling exhibitions relating to Canadian military history. The four galleries document the military history of Canada, with the four galleries being Early Wars in Canada, South African and the First World War, Second World War, and From the Cold War to the Present. In 1935, Doughty struck a deal with General Andrew McNaughton, the Chief of General Staff, for the militia to support the establishment of the museum. As a result of the closure of the Public Archive\'s history museum, the Public Archives began to regularly transfer archival documents to the war museum. T', 'From Museum:\nThe site dates from c.\u2009530 BC, and contained artifacts from earlier Mesopotamian civilizations. Since the establishment of the earliest known museum in ancient times, museums have been associated with academia and the preservation of rare items.

Some museums seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while others have specific audiences, like the LDS Church History Museum or local history organizations. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g., museums of modern art, folk art, local history, military history, aviation history, philately, agriculture, or geology. Gallery – Museum storage\nPlanning\nThe design of museums has evolved throughout history. Since 1868, several monolithic human figures known as Moai have been removed from Easter Island and put in display in major Western museums such as the National Museum of Natural History, the British Museum, the Louvre and the Royal Museums of Art and History.

Museums can also be categorized into major groups by the type of collections they display, to include: fine arts, applied arts, craft, archaeology, anthropology and ethnology, biography, history, cultural history, science, technology, children\'s museums, natural history, botanical and zoological gardens. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item. History\nAncient\nOne of the oldest museums known is Ennigaldi-Nanna\'s museum, built by Princess Ennigaldi in modern Iraq at the end of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. In the late 19th century, museums of natural history exemplified the scientific drive for classifying life and interpreting the world. Concurrently, as American colleges expanded during the 19th century, they also developed their own natural history collections to support the education of their students. Additionally, there is a legal definition of museum in United States legislation authorizing the establishment of the Institute of Museum and Library Services: ""Museum means a public, tribal, or private nonprofit institution which is organized on a permanent basis for essentially educational, cultural heritage, or aesthetic purposes and which, using a professional staff: Owns or uses tangible objects, either animate or inanimate; Cares for these objects; and Exhibits them to the general public on a regular basis"" (Museum Services Act 1976). The 18th-century scholars of the Age of Enlightenment saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on ""organization and taxonomy"" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi. The Canadian Museums Association\'s definition: ""A museum is a non-profit, permanent establishment, that does not exist primarily for the purpose of conducting temporary exhibitions and that is open to the public during regular hours and administered in the public interest for the purpose of conserving, preserving, studying, interpreting, assembling and exhibiting to the public for the instruction and enjoyment of the public, objects and specimens or educational and cultural value including artistic, scientific, historical and technological material."" History\nIn the United States, labor unrest within the arts and cultural sector go back at least nearly a century to 1933 when a New York-based collective of artists eventually known as the Artist\'s Union used collective bargaining for state relief for unemployed artists. While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient Egypt, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome). Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a museum planning process. Educator – Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. All museum employees should work together toward the museum\'s institutional goal. The size of a museum\'s collection typically determines the museum\'s size, whereas its collection reflects the type of museum it is. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian John Cotton Dana.

The Museum and Art Gallery occupied an extended part of the Council House above the new offices of the municipal Gas Department (which in effect subsidised the venture thus circumventing the Public Libraries Act 1850 which limited the use of public funds on the arts). Due to the global pandemic, the museum closed in October 2020. In 2001, the Science Museum closed with some exhibits being transferred to Thinktank, Birmingham Science Museum, which was operated by the independent Thinktank Trust that has since become part of Birmingham Museums Trust.

The origin of the museum is the collections of art and historical objects gathered by Swedish monarchs since the 16th century. The museum\'s collection of Swedish ecclesiastical art is extensive, and its origins span from the 12th century to the post-Reformation period.

The large number of preserved objects made from precious metals, is due to a law that was issued in the 17th century, stating that all such finds that were 100 years or older and with no owner, were to be redeemed by the government and sent to the History museum. Function\nThe History Museum is part of a central museum agency called the Statens historiska museer (SHM) (""National Historical Museums""). When plans for the new Nordic Museum building were made in 1876, it was suggested that the building should also include the History Museum\'s collections. Founded in 1866, it operates as a government agency and is tasked with preserving Swedish historical items as well as making knowledge about history available to the public. In 2010, a new permanent exhibition called Sweden\'s History opened. A common item with the workers who cast the doors and built the museum. Other museums under the aegis of this agency are The Royal Armouries, The Economy Museum, Skokloster Castle, The Hallwyl Museum, The Tumba Papermill Museum and The Swedish Holocaust Museum. Interior\nThe interior of the museum is spacious with room for both permanent and special exhibitions. The doors, called The Gates of History (Historiens Portar), took him thirteen years to make. The floor and pillars in the room are made of limestone and diabase, and the décor is made from wrought iron. They developed the design for the new museum in cooperation with Curman, the National Property Board and the National Heritage Board. The museum consists of four two- and three-story block-like buildings surrounding an inner courtyard, giving it the appearance of a fortress.

Through a series of ten fields, the doors depict the history of Sweden from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages. Exterior\nThe main building, designed by Romare and Scherman 1935–1940, reflects an ambivalence between the predominant modern style of the era and the historical context given not only by the context requirements, but also the 19th century barracks and stables south of the museum designed by Fredrik Blom and built in stages in 1805–1818, starting one year after the land had been appropriated by the government.

On 20 June, Oxfam announced it would release Stand As One – Live at Glastonbury 2016, an album of live performances from the 2016 Glastonbury Festival, in memory of Cox. In July 2016, organisers of the annual Tolpuddle Martyrs\' Festival, an event in Dorset celebrating the efforts of a group of agricultural workers to form a trade union, dedicated that year\'s event to Cox\'s memory. One day after the attack, Corbyn and Prime Minister David Cameron visited Birstall, where they joined locals to lay floral tributes to Cox. The referendum resulted in a vote in favour of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union. The incident was the first killing of a sitting British MP since the death of Conservative MP Ian Gow, who was assassinated by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1990, and the first murder of a politician in the United Kingdom during an attack since county councillor Andrew Pennington was killed in 2000. In November 2016, MPs and musicians collaborated on a version of The Rolling Stones song ""You Can\'t Always Get What You Want"" for release as a charity single in Cox\'s memory and to raise funds for the launch of the Jo Cox Foundation. The nomination was also supported by members of Canada\'s New Democratic Party, who urged Stéphane Dion, the country\'s Foreign Affairs Minister, to give his backing on behalf of Canada. Musicians and festivalgoers at Glastonbury, held later that week, also paid tribute to Cox; at one concert Billy Bragg led the audience in a rendition of ""We Shall Overcome"" and was joined on stage by women wearing suffragette ribbons. United Kingdom\nCox\'s husband Brendan issued a statement on 16 June, the day of her death, which said:Today is the beginning of a new chapter in our lives. First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon described the news as ""utterly shocking and tragic news, which has left everyone stunned"". The Great Get Together was also supported by former British Prime Ministers John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron, all of whom who recorded a joint video paying tribute to Cox and urging people to celebrate her life. Earlier that year, Cox had written to the Committee praising the work of the civilian voluntary emergency rescue organisation known as the White Helmets, and nominating them for the prize. Friends organised ""More in Common – Celebrating the life of Jo Cox"", a public event in her remembrance held in Trafalgar Square, London, on 22 June – the date of her 42nd birthday. The video was aired as part of Channel 4\'s late-night talk show The Last Leg on the eve of the first anniversary of her death. United States President Barack Obama telephoned Cox\'s husband to offer condolences on behalf of the American people, and invited the family to meet him at the White House. Only two British newspapers did not feature a picture of Cox on their front pages as her murderer was arrested: the Financial Times, which focused on the first autumn statement from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond; and the Daily Mail. On 20 July, the House of Commons Estimates Committee voted to strip IPSA of this responsibility amid concerns over the time-frame of the process. In its print edition, the Mail placed its coverage of Mair\'s conviction on page 30, which prompted LBC radio presenter James O\'Brien to accuse the paper of double standards, saying the Mail ""has chosen to put the murder by a neo-Nazi of a serving British MP ... on page 30. Chief Minister of Gibraltar Fabian Picardo stated, ""This is a truly appalling attack on a serving MP working hard to serve her community. As confirmed by the Crown Prosecution Service, Mair\'s conviction for a crime amounting to a terrorism offence also means he is officially classed as a terrorist by the United Kingdom. Mair had links to British and American far-right political groups including the neo-fascist National Front, the United States-based neo-Nazi organisation National Vanguard (the successor to the defunct National Alliance) and the English Defence League; he had attended far-right gatherings and purchased publications from the National Vanguard and other outlets, to some of which he had sent letters and expressed support for South African apartheid. He believed individuals of liberal and left-wing political viewpoints, and the mainstream media, were the cause of the world\'s problems.

Before the album\'s release the band headed to Europe for a number of summer festival dates, including an unannounced set at Glastonbury Festival, where Stoermer joined them to perform on the John Peel Stage, the same stage they had performed on during their first appearance at the festival 13 years earlier. Due to high ticket demand, the Killers began headlining arenas including Madison Square Garden for the first time and also headlined a number of major European festivals during 2007, including Glastonbury Festival. They have performed in over 50 countries and on six continents, headlining venues such as Madison Square Garden, Wembley Stadium,  Glastonbury Festival (2007 and 2019), and Electric Picnic in Ireland in 2023.

The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas in 2001 by Brandon Flowers (lead vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (lead guitar, backing vocals). After going through a number of short-term bassists and drummers in their early days, both Mark Stoermer (bass, rhythm guitar, backing vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci Jr. (drums, percussion) joined the band in 2002. The Killers have released seven studio albums, each of which reached the top spot on the UK Albums Chart: Hot Fuss (2004), Sam\'s Town (2006), Day & Age (2008), Battle Born (2012), Wonderful Wonderful (2017), Imploding the Mirage (2020), and Pressure Machine (2021).

Since 2016 and 2017 respectively, both Stoermer and Keuning have had extended periods of hiatus from the band, though both returned as official members. Stoermer mostly retired from touring, citing both exhaustion from the road and lingering effects from a pyrotechnics accident, while Keuning has released a solo album. Despite his hiatus from touring, Stoermer participated in recording sessions for Wonderful Wonderful and Imploding the Mirage, and it was announced that Keuning was participating in recording Pressure Machine, which was released on August 13, 2021. Ted Sablay, who had served as a touring keyboardist and rhythm guitarist for the band since 2006, assumed lead guitar duties for live shows in Keuning\'s absence, while touring rhythm guitarist and keyboardist Jake Blanton took up the job of bassist and took Stoermer\'s place in live shows. With Sablay moving to lead guitar, the band hired Taylor Milne and Robbie Connolly to play rhythm guitar and keyboards live.

Prime ministerial power itself evolved gradually alongside the office itself which have played an increasingly prominent role in British politics since the early 20th century. In recent occasions, the 2003 invasion of Iraq saw Prime Minister Tony Blair deploying British troops to Saudi Arabia without the immediate consent or approval of parliament. In 1928, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs:In this country we live ... under an unwritten Constitution. During the 18th and 19th centuries, many prime ministers were members of the British nobility and therefore held the office whilst serving in the House of Lords. Bagehot famously called the British system as one where ""the executive power is now yielded by the prime minister"" rather than the monarch, a shift from personal to political power. The British constitution consists of many documents, and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice. Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation. Constitutional background\nThe British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution, meaning that it is not set out in any single document. The estate was previously owned by the Conservative minister and First Lord of the Admiralty, Sir Arthur Lee, before being donated to the British government under the Chequers Estate Act 1917. These vehicles are often custom made and always British manufactured with in-built gun ports, an independent oxygen supply and the ability to release tear gas to subdue angry crowds. As ""prime minister"" is a position, not a title, the incumbent should be referred to as ""the prime minister"", although the title ""Prime Minister"" (e.g. The power of the office of prime minister has grown significantly since the first prime minister, Robert Walpole in 1721. The prime minister makes many international trips. The fleet of Prime Ministerial Cars provides the prime minister with a number of security features as well as transport. :\u200a3.1\n\nPrime Minister\'s Office\nThe Prime Minister\'s Office helps the prime minister to \'establish and deliver the government\'s overall strategy and policy priorities, and to communicate the government\'s policies to Parliament, the public and international audiences\'. Deputy\nPrime ministers have had various deputies, sometimes as an official deputy prime minister, first secretary of state or de facto deputy. Prime Minister\'s Questions\nPrime Minister\'s Questions is a constitutional convention, currently held as a single session every Wednesday at noon when the House of Commons is sitting, in which the prime minister answers questions from members of Parliament (MPs). There can be no automatic assumption about who The Queen would ask to act as caretaker Prime Minister in the event of the death of the Prime Minister. An outgoing prime minister can ask the monarch to bestow honours on any number of people of their choosing, known as the Prime Minister\'s Resignation Honours. Security and transport\nThe personal protection of the prime minister and former prime ministers is the responsibility of Protection Command within the Metropolitan Police Service. In 1881, questions addressed to the prime minister were placed at the end of question time so that the then 72-year old Prime Minister William Gladstone could arrive late. The prime minister\'s parliamentary powers also extend to foreign relations. Additionally, the prime minister can exercise considerable control over parliamentary time. After resigning, the outgoing prime minister remains a Member of Parliament. Ministerial responsibility is also an aspect of a prime minister\'s executive authority. Only one prime minister has been assassinated: Spencer Perceval, in 1812. The Powers Behind the Prime Minister:The Hidden Influence of Number Ten. As such, the modern prime minister leads the Cabinet (the Executive). There is also no such title as acting prime minister of the United Kingdom. No incumbent prime minister has ever lost their own seat at a general election. ""P', ""From Spouse of the prime minister of the United Kingdom:\nTo date, forty-seven women and three men have been married to the British prime minister in office.

The NFL confirmed that the substitutions and plays by the Patriots were legal. With the pass, Brady set a new NFL record with 46 career postseason touchdown passes. Despite their championship drought, the Patriots remained a dominant NFL dynasty throughout the 2000s and early 2010s. A 23-yard completion to Gronkowski earlier on the drive gave Brady 6,595 career passing yards in the postseason, a new NFL record. Brady, extending his NFL record of playoff starts to 28, finished 23 of 35 for 226 yards three touchdowns and 1 interception. With the win the Patriots advanced to 2–1 and Brady won his 150th career game, 3rd most by a starting quarterback in NFL history. Luck has thrown 9 career interceptions in three games played at Gillette Stadium. The 2014 season was the New England Patriots' 45th in the National Football League (NFL), their 55th overall and their 15th under head coach Bill Belichick. A 27-yard pass to Gronkowski earlier in the drive gave Brady 50,000 career passing yards, making him the 6th quarterback in NFL history to throw for 50,000 career yards. Week 11: at Indianapolis Colts\nThe 7–2 Patriots faced the 6–3 Colts in a primetime match up on Sunday Night Football, with two of the best passing offenses in the NFL. In 2007, the Patriots completed just the second undefeated regular season in the history of the modern NFL (the first being their division rival Miami Dolphins in 1972), as well as the first since the league expanded its seasons to sixteen games (though only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl). Week 4: at Kansas City Chiefs\nIn front of a crowd that set the new record for highest decibel level at an NFL game, the Chiefs dismantled the Patriots 41–14 on Monday Night Football. They finished fourth in the NFL in scoring (468 points) and eighth in points allowed (313), and first in point differential (with an average margin of victory of 9.7 points). Postseason\nAFC Divisional Playoffs: vs. #6 Baltimore Ravens\nThe Patriots became the third team in NFL history to erase two 14 point deficits to win a game (the last to do it was the 2003 Chiefs) and the first to pull off the feat in a playoff game, rallying from down 14–0 and 28–14 to win 35–31. Before the game, the Patriots paid tribute to Bengals defensive tackle Devon Still, whose daughter is battling cancer, with a short film during a television timeout saluting his daughter while the Patriots cheerleaders donned Devon Still #75 jerseys; the gesture and donation by the Kraft family to the Cincinnati hospital at which she is being treated, brought a standing ovation and moved Still to tears. On February 1, 2015, the Patriots played the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX. On the next play, Wilson's pass, intended for Ricardo Lockette, was intercepted by undrafted free-agent rookie Malcolm Butler on the goal line with 20 seconds remaining. In those four games, the Patriots have outscored the Colts 189–73. Both running games struggled, limited to 109 combined yards on the ground. The Patriots defense once again played well, holding the Bills to just 268 total yards and forced a turnover. Jay Cutler actually played well, completing 20 of 30 passes for 220 yards and three touchdowns, but threw an interception and lost a fumble. It was learned shortly after the game that stalwart defensive end Chandler Jones injured his hip and would miss seven games. The Patriots looked nothing like the team that had won 7 straight games, struggling in all facets of the game. Following a 17-yard Russell Wilson scramble to the Patriots 44, Wilson lofted a 23-yard completion Ricardo Lockette and, with an additional 10 yards on a Kyle Arrington facemask penalty, moved the ball to the Patriots' 11-yard line with 0:06 seconds remaining in the half. The Patriots defense played well in the first half, forcing three turnovers and holding the Dolphins to just ten points, but allowed 23 points and forced no turnovers in the second half.

The Patriots featured several key additions: Brandon LaFell, Darrelle Revis, and Brandon Browner (even though he was suspended "", 'From Minnesota Twins:\nThe Twins and the Red Sox started the weekend tied for 1st place and played against each other in Boston for the final two games of the season. After a year where the Twins played .500 baseball for most of the season, the team won 17 of their last 21 games to tie the Detroit Tigers for the lead in the Central Division. The team has played at Target Field since 2010. Roster\nMinnesota Twins all-time roster: A complete list of players who played in at least one game for the Twins franchise. The Twins played in Metropolitan Stadium from 1961 to 1981 and in the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome from 1982 to 2009. The Atlanta Braves won all three of their games in Atlanta, and the Twins won all four of their games in Minnesota. Furthermore, they said sharing a stadium with the NFL\'s Minnesota Vikings, as they had been doing since their 1961 move to Minnesota, limited the team\'s revenue and made it difficult to sustain a top-notch, competitive team. The Twins went 12–1 in postseason home games during those two seasons, becoming the first and second teams to sweep all four home games in a World Series. That year, the Twins won 91 games, the most by the franchise since 1933. However, Killebrew played seven seasons as a Senator, including two full seasons as a regular prior to the move to Minnesota in 1961. The Twins also brought back the navy-brimmed red cap for a few games with the home navy alternates. There was no acknowledgment of the Twins\' prior championships in Washington and several Senator Hall of Famers, such as Walter Johnson, played in the days prior to numbers being used on uniforms. The first regular-season game in Target Field was played against the Boston Red Sox on April 12, 2010, with Mauer driving in two runs and going 3-for-5 to help the Twins defeat the Red Sox, 5–2. Scoreboard operators sometimes played an animated sequence of piranhas munching under that caption in situations where the Twins were scoring runs playing ""small ball"", and the stadium vendors sold T-shirts and hats advertising ""The Little Piranhas"". 2010 marked Minnesota\'s inaugural season played at Target Field, where the Twins finished the regular season with a record of 94–68, clinching the AL Central Division title for the 6th time in 9 years under manager Ron Gardenhire. With Killebrew slugging 49 homers and winning the AL MVP Award, these 1969 Twins won the first American League Western Division Championship, but they lost three straight games to the Baltimore Orioles, winners of 109 games, in the first American League Championship Series. The Senators posted a 99–53 record and cruised to the pennant seven games ahead of the New York Yankees, but in the 1933 World Series the Giants exacted their revenge, winning in five games. The Twins and Tigers both finished one game back, with 91–71 records, while the White Sox finished three games back, at 89–73. They turned the season around somewhat, but still lost 102 games, finishing with what is currently the second-worst record in Twins history (beaten only by the 2016 team, which lost 103 games), despite the .301 average, 23 homers and 92 RBI from rookie Kent Hrbek. For a few games during the 1997 season, the Twins wore red alternate uniforms, which featured navy piping and letters in white trimmed in navy. MVP season and Oliva\'s batting title, the Twins won 102 games and the American League Pennant in 1965, but they were defeated in the World Series by the Los Angeles Dodgers in seven games (behind the Series MVP, Sandy Koufax, who compiled a 2–1 record, including winning the seventh game). The Red Sox won both games, seizing their first pennant since 1946 with a 92–70 record. The two teams traded wins back and forth with three games of the first six being decided by one run. Minnesota\n\nTeam and franchise traditions\nFans wave a Homer Hanky to rally the team during play-offs and other crucial games. The party atmosphere of the Twins clubhouse after a win is well known, the team\'s players unwinding with loud rock music (usually the choice of the winning pitcher) and video games. Johnson won 33 games while teammate Bob Groom added another 24 wins to help the Senators finish the season in second place. In this Series, four games were won during the teams\' final at-bat, and three of these were in extra innings. The seventh game of the 1991 World Series is widely regarded as one of the greatest games in the history of professional baseball. In October 2024, as a result of bankruptcy proceedings involving former broadcaster Diamond Sports Group, Major League Baseball\'s local media division announced that it would take over the production and distribution of Twins games starting with the 2025 season. Up until then, it was the second time in MLB history when a team won all its home games on their way to winning the World Series. They ended up making the playoffs, which made them the first ever team to lose 100 games the previous year and make the playoffs the next season. Black people don\'t go', 'From Donovan McNabb:\nHaving played nearly up to full speed in the preseason games, it was decided that McNabb would return to the field several months short of the full year-long recovery expected of an ACL injury. The NFL placed this game at #69 on its list of 100 greatest games in the first 100 years of NFL history. He played college football for the Syracuse Orange and was selected with the second overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft by the Eagles, where he spent 11 seasons. Donovan Jamal McNabb (born November 25, 1976) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 13 seasons, primarily with the Philadelphia Eagles. They have four children: daughter Alexis, who was born on September 23, 2004, twins Sariah and Donovan Jr., who were born in 2008, and Devin James, who was born in 2009. He also excelled at track and field, and played basketball with Antoine Walker. Including the playoffs, he threw touchdown passes in 15 of 18 games and two-or-more in 12 of those games. McNabb and the Eagles began the 2006 season with a fast start to 4–1, at that time leading the NFL in six offensive categories with McNabb becoming the first NFL quarterback to start a season with at least 1,500 yards passing, 10-plus TDs, and no more than one interception through his first five games. In week 4, on October 3, McNabb played against the Eagles for the first time, returning with the Redskins to Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The Eagles split their next four games.

He serves as an analyst for ESPN\'s College GameDay, a television program covering college football, and provides color commentary on college football games on ESPN and ABC and Thursday night NFL games on Prime Video. A week later, Herbstreit and Rece Davis worked a special Monday Night Football MegaCast on ESPN2 for the Saints–Raiders game, the first ever NFL game to be played in Las Vegas, on the night in which Monday Night Football celebrated its 50th anniversary. From 1989 to 1993, Herbstreit played football as a quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes. The games in Ohio are usually held at Ohio Stadium, while the games in Texas are held at AT&T Stadium. That same day, Herbstreit agreed to an extension of his contract with ESPN to allow him to continue on GameDay, Saturday Night Football, and the NFL Draft, to go along with his new NFL duties for Amazon. Tye played football as a walk-on at Clemson University; Jake walked on at Clemson before transferring to Ohio State to focus on academics. He has four golden retrievers, one of whom, Ben, traveled with him to games. On March 23, 2022, Herbstreit was announced as the new color commentator for Thursday Night Football on Prime Video, alongside NFL play-by-play announcer Al Michaels. I try to every day walk that path.“\nHis hobbies include playing EA Sports video games, and working out. In 2018, Herbstreit was announced to replace Jon Gruden for night one of ESPN\'s NFL Draft coverage, as Gruden left to return to the then-Oakland, now Las Vegas Raiders. Herbstreit passed for 1,904 yards that season, including four 200-plus-yard games, before losing to the Georgia Bulldogs in the Florida Citrus Bowl. A frequent contributor to ESPN.com and ESPN The Magazine, Herbstreit has worked as a color commentator for ESPN\'s Thursday night college football games. Kirk Edward Herbstreit (; born August 19, 1969) is an American sportscaster and former college football player. For his TV work, Herbstreit has won five Sports Emmy Awards in various categories. He appeared annually as a commentator in EA Sports\' NCAA Football video game series, including after a ten-year hiatus. Playing career and subsequent activities in Ohio\nHerbstreit graduated from Centerville High School in Centerville, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. As a quarterback for the Elks, he was the Ohio Gatorade Player of the Year as a senior. He also was a standout basketball and baseball player. Herbstreit was the first player to commit to the Ohio State Buckeyes after the hiring of John Cooper as head coach in 1988. Herbstreit was a four-year letterman as a quarterback at Ohio State University from 1989 to 1993. After waiting his turn behind Greg Frey and Kent Graham, Herbstreit finally led the team as a senior in 1992. That year, he was a co-captain (along with linebacker Steve Tovar) and voted team MVP. Herbstreit set the Ohio State record for pass completions (28) in the rivalry game against Michigan, throwing for 271 yards in a 13–13 tie in 1992. The record stood until 2006, when it was broken by Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith. Herbstreit graduated from Ohio State in 1993 with a degree in business administration. Herbstreit\'s father, Jim Herbstreit, was a co-captain (along with offensive tackle Jim Tyrer) of the 1960 Ohio State team, and later an assistant coach at Ohio State under Woody Hayes. When Herbstreit was named co-captain in 1992, the two became only the second father-and-son duo to have each been Ohio State captains. (James and Jeff Davidson were the first in 1989; Pepper and Dionte Johnson became the third in 2007.) He also is known for a 2009 case in which he sued the IRS for changing an implied policy of allowing deductions for house donations to the fire department for training purposes. Herbstreit is actively involved in multiple charities including the Buckeye Cruise for Cancer and The Make A Wish Foundation Ultimate Sports Auction. He has lent his name to the Kirk Herbstreit National Kickoff Classic in Columbus, Ohio, and Arlington, Texas. According to the website, the Kickoff Classic ""pits high school teams from the states of Ohio and Texas against prep football powerhouses from across the nation"" over the Labor Day weekend. Broadcasting career\nHerbstreit joined ESPN in September 1995 as a college football sideline analyst. The following year he joined College GameDay, an ESPN program with which he has become almost synonymous, as a lead analyst. He continues to serve in that role alongside host Rece Davis and fellow analysts Desmond Howard, Pat McAfee, Lee Corso, and Nick Saban. He also serves as the lead game analyst for ESPN and ABC, a responsibility that sees him travel to ESPN\'s biggest game that week for ABC Saturday Night Football to call the marquee game alongside former GameDay host and longtime colleague Chris Fowler and sideline reporter Holly Rowe. Herbstreit was nominated fo', 'From Sean McVay:\nIn the first NFL playoff game played on Monday Night Football, the Rams defeated their NFC West rival, the Arizona Cardinals, by a score of 34–11. Sean\'s father, Tim, played football as a defensive back at Indiana University. Before a Week 9 bye, they won two games against the Atlanta Falcons and Cincinnati Bengals. Regardless, in just five games, the Rams offense scored a total of 142 (later 151) points, a league leader and franchise high. They then won their next two games against the Indianapolis Colts, and the reigning Super Bowl champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers before losing to the Arizona Cardinals. College career\nMcVay attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he played college football as a wide receiver from 2004 to 2007, earning Miami\'s Scholar-Athlete Award in 2007. In an NFC Wild Card game played at Ford Field, the Los Angeles Rams lost a close contest 24–23 to the host Detroit Lions, in what marked in Detroit\'s first playoff win in 32 seasons. Despite the loss, the Rams\' first under McVay after they had led at halftime (a streak of 45 straight games), the Rams claimed the NFC West division title by virtue of Arizona\'s loss to Seattle that same day. On January 19, 2018, he was named NFL Coach of the Year by the Associated Press. The victory made McVay the youngest head coach in NFL history to win the Super Bowl at age 36. Though Los Angeles dropped three of its next four games against San Francisco (30–23), Cincinnati (19–16), and Philadelphia (23–14), the Rams displayed unexpected resilience against a trio of teams widely expected to contend for the Super Bowl. But Williams suffered a severe ankle sprain that sidelined him on injured reserve for a month, and that, combined with injuries to quarterback Matthew Stafford and wide receiver Cooper Kupp, hampered the Rams who dropped three straight games going into the bye week. McVay is also the youngest head coach to win a Super Bowl and be named NFL Coach of the Year. After defeating the Seattle Seahawks 36–31 in Week 10, the Rams beat the Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 54–51 in Week 11 on Monday Night Football in a highly anticipated matchup that was originally scheduled to be played in Mexico City, but was shifted to Los Angeles due to poor field conditions. He became the youngest NFL head coach in the modern era when he was hired by the Rams in 2017 at the age of 30. His success in Los Angeles is credited with spawning the ""Sean McVay effect"", in which NFL teams were more inclined to hire younger, offensive-minded head coaches. Sean McVay (born January 24, 1986) is an American professional football coach who is the head coach of the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League (NFL). McVay would remain the youngest head coach in the NFL until the New England Patriots hired Jerod Mayo on January 12, 2024, exactly seven years to the day after McVay was hired by the Rams. McVay\'s grandfather, John McVay, was also an NFL head coach, having coached the New York Giants from 1976 to 1978 before going on to serve as an executive for the San Francisco 49ers between 1980 and 1999. With Williams surpassing 1,000 yards rushing, Nacua setting numerous NFL rookie receiving records and the impressive play of rookie defensive stars Kobie Turner at nose tackle and Byron Young at linebacker, the Rams rolled to four straight victories to end the season. The hiring made him the youngest head coach in the NFL\'s modern era, surpassing Lane Kiffin, who was 31 years, 259 days old when hired by the Oakland Raiders in 2007, and the youngest since 27-year-old Art Lewis became interim head coach of the Rams in 1938. The following week in the controversial NFC Championship Game, the Rams beat the Saints on the road by a score of 26–23 in overtime on a game-winning field goal by Greg Zuerlein in overtime to send the Rams to Super Bowl LIII, their first NFL championship appearance since Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002. McVay totaled 2,600 yards rushing and 40 rushing touchdowns during his career and also passed for 2,500 yards and 18 touchdowns, leading the War Eagles to a 26–3 record, including a 14–1 record and state championship his senior year, when he was also named the Georgia 4A Offensive Player of the Year over future NFL Hall of Fame wide receiver Calvin Johnson. The Rams went on to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars on the road by a score of 27–17 in Week 6 and the Arizona Cardinals by a score of 33–0 in an NFL International Series game for the team\'s first shutout win since 2014, as well as raising their record to 5–2 for the first time since 2004 (the last time the team made the playoffs) and a first-place lead in the NFC West.

In 2008, the patch became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City's home and away jerseys.

However, the team was made up of Catholic priests and was not considered the Vatican City national team. In 2006, the Vatican City played SV Vollmond, a team from Switzerland, at Stadio Petriana with Vatican City prevailing 5–1. The Vatican\'s stance on football\nVatican footballing history began on 7 January 1521 when the first match of Calcio Fiorentino was played in the Vatican in the Cortile del Belvedere, in the presence of Pope Benedict XV. In 2006, UEFA spokesperson William Gaillard told a media outlet that he saw no reason why Vatican City should not have a national team in international competitions. Additionally, on 18 December 2006, Tarcisio Bertone, Cardinal Secretary of State of the Holy See, stated, but only in jest, that he did not preclude the possibility that the Vatican, in the future, could put together a football team of great value, that could play on the same level as, Roma, Internazionale and Milan or Genoa. His first match as manager was played on 23 October 2010 when Vatican City faced a team composed of Italian financial police. In 2006, Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone suggested that the Vatican could field a team of men from Catholic seminaries. In October 2007, the Pope was presented with a #16 shirt (in reference to the sixteenth use of his papal name) by Serie B side Ancona after Benedict supported their initiative to become a ""beacon of morality"" by adopting an ""innovative, ethical model of practising football"".

Benedict is quoted as saying, ""The sport of football can be a vehicle of education for the values of honesty, solidarity and fraternity, especially for the younger generation."" In May 2014, Domenico Ruggerio, president of the national football association, reinforced Bertone\'s words from eight years prior, stating that ""I prefer to be amateur...To join FIFA, at that level, will be like a business"" after stating ""The important message of friendship and love is demonstrated by the sport — the real sport, not the business that is in football these days...It is not just important to win a match; it is how you carry yourself."" At that time Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone insisted that the Vatican\'s football future lies only in amateur games and competitions. The team has also competed against a representative team from the Diocese of Limburg. In addition to its full international matches, the team has played a friendly match, its first, against the San Marino reserve team in 1994. When Vatican City played its first match in 2002, only one player, Marcello Rosati, had a Vatican passport. In September 2016 the team participated in a triangular tournament at the Manlio Scopigno Stadium in Rieti to raise funds for earthquake victims.

This incorporation of traditional British folk music influences gives British folk rock its distinctly British character and flavour. The Beatles and the British Invasion\nBeginning in 1964 and lasting until roughly 1966, a wave of British beat groups, including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Dave Clark Five, Gerry & the Pacemakers, the Kinks, and Herman\'s Hermits amongst others, dominated the U.S. music charts. This heightened degree of emotional introspection was inspired by her love of Bob Dylan\'s folk songwriting and represents one of the first attempts by an American artist to absorb folk sensibilities into rock music. Inspired by British psychedelic folk and the North American style of folk rock, British folk rock bands began to incorporate elements of traditional British folk music into their repertoire, leading to other variants, including the overtly English folk rock of the Albion Band and Celtic rock. Skiffle renewed popularity of folk music forms in Britain and led directly to the progressive folk movement and the attendant British folk club scene. During the late 1960s, many folk rock artists including Dylan, Ian and Sylvia, and the Byrds began to incorporate a strong country influence into their music, drawing heavily on Hank Williams, Merle Haggard, and Buck Owens amongst others, resulting in the concurrent offshoot of country rock. Related movements\nBritish folk rock\nBritish folk rock developed in Britain during the mid to late 1960s by the bands Fairport Convention, and Pentangle. Bands whose music was significantly folk rock in sound during the mid-to-late 1960s included Donovan, the Lovin\' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas, the Youngbloods, Love, and, in their early years, Jefferson Airplane.

Both viewed British folk music as a vehicle for leftist political concepts and an antidote to the American-dominated popular music of the time. This melding of folk and rock \'n\' roll in the Beatles\' music became even more explicit during 1965, with the release of ""You\'ve Got to Hide Your Love Away"", a folk-derived song with introspective lyrics, again influenced by Dylan. The influence of these acts also impacted on the collegiate folk and urban folk communities, with many young musicians quickly losing interest in folk music and instead embracing the rock \'n\' roll derived repertoire of the British Invasion. However, it was not until 1956 and the advent of the skiffle craze that the British folk revival crossed over into the mainstream and connected with British youth culture. During the 1950s and early 1960s in the UK, a parallel folk revival referred to as the second British folk revival, was led by folk singers Ewan MacColl and Bert Lloyd. The genre was pioneered by the Byrds, who began playing traditional folk music and songs by Bob Dylan with rock instrumentation, in a style heavily influenced by the Beatles and other British Invasion bands. Other precursors\nAlthough folk rock mainly grew out of a mix of American folk revival and British Invasion influences, there were also a few examples of proto-folk rock that were important in the development of the genre. During the late 1960s in Britain and Europe, a distinct, eclectic British folk rock style was created by Pentangle, Fairport Convention and Alan Stivell. The single\'s success initiated the folk rock boom of 1965 and 1966, during which a profusion of Byrds-influenced acts flooded the American and British charts. In addition to The Beatles, the two British groups that were arguably the most influential on the development of folk rock were the Animals and the Searchers. Future members of many folk rock acts, including the Byrds, Jefferson Airplane, the Lovin\' Spoonful, the Mamas & the Papas, and Buffalo Springfield, all turned their backs on traditional folk music during 1964 and 1965 as a direct result of the influence of the Beatles and the other British Invasion bands. Of particular importance to the development of folk rock by the British Invasion were the subtle folk influences evident in such Beatles\' compositions as ""I\'ll Be Back"", ""Things We Said Today"", and ""I\'m a Loser"", with the latter song being directly inspired by folk singer-songwriter Bob Dylan. In particular, the Byrds\' influence can be discerned in mid-1960s recordings by acts such as the Lovin\' Spoonful, Barry McGuire, the Mamas & the Papas, Simon & Garfunkel, Jefferson Airplane, the Turtles, We Five, Love, and Sonny & Cher.

The British Library Sound Archive contains thousands of recordings of traditional English folk music, including 340 wax cylinder recordings made by Percy Grainger in the early 1900s. There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are religious, supernatural, tragic, love, historic, legends and humour. He recorded The Foggy Dew and Other Traditional English Love Songs in 1959, and then The Bird in the Bush, Traditional Erotic Songs in 1966 with Frankie Armstrong, and Anne Briggs. Progressive folk\nThe process of fusion between American musical styles and English folk can also be seen as the origin of British progressive folk music, which attempted to elevate folk music through greater musicianship, or compositional and arrangement skills. London\nDespite being the centre of both folk revivals and the British folk rock movement, the songs of London were largely neglected in favour of regional and rural music until relatively recently. those that dealt with love and suggested sexuality through innuendo (like 'The Bonny Black Hare' and 'The Bird in the Bush'), and pornographic songs that were explicit and therefore unworthy of attention. It has also interacted with other musical traditions, particularly classical and rock music, influencing musical styles and producing musical fusions, such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal. Folk clubs\nAlthough there were a handful of clubs that allowed space for the performance of traditional folk music by the early 1950s, its major boost came from the short-lived British skiffle craze, from about 1956–8. Recently bands like Sacred Turf, Skwardya and Krena, have begun performing British folk rock in the Cornish language. As regimental identities emerged songs were adopted for marching, like 'The British Grenadiers', based on a 17th-century dance tune. Erotic folk songs\nIt has been noted by most recent commentators on English folk song even if it was a bit immoral, that love, the erotic and even the pornographic, were major traditional themes and, if more than ballads are considered, may have been the largest groups of printed songs. Morris dance took something of a back seat to unaccompanied singing in the second revival, but received a further boost when it attracted the attention of British folk rock musicians like Ashley Hutchings, who produced several albums of dance music, including the influential Morris On series from 1972. The EFDSS sponsored the BBC Home Service radio program, As I Roved Out, based on field recordings made by Peter Kennedy and Séamus Ennis from 1952 to 1958, which probably did more than any other single factor to introduce the general population to British folk music in the period. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. Some of these revivalists recorded folk songs on wax cylinders, and many of the recordings, including Percy Grainger's collection, are available online courtesy of the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library and the British Library Sound Archive. Folk metal\nIn a process strikingly similar to the origins of British folk rock in the 1960s, the English thrash metal band Skyclad added violins from a session musician on several tracks for their 1990 debut album The Wayward Sons of Mother Earth. Probably the largest is Fairport's Cropredy Convention, which since 1979 has provided a venue for folk, British folk rock, and rock artists; it now attracts up to 20,000 people a year as well as performances for Fairport Convention and their friends. East Anglia made a contribution to the British folk rock scene of the 1970s, producing the short-lived, but more recently reformed, bands Midwinter and Stone Angel, based in Great Yarmouth and the more successful Spriguns of Tolgus from Cambridge, who produced four albums. War songs\nIn England songs about military and nava"", 'From Music of the United Kingdom:\nOther subgenres of rock invented by or radically changed by British acts include blues rock, ska, British folk rock, folk punk, shoegaze, and Britpop. According to AllMusic, the emergence of psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s resulted from British bands who made up the British Invasion of the US market. During the early 1960s, the British Invasion, led by the Beatles, further entrenched British performers as major drivers of the development of pop and rock music. The ""British Invasion""—spearheaded by Liverpool band the Beatles, often regarded as the most influential band of all time—saw British rock bands become highly influential around the world in the 1960s and 1970s. This wave of popular British soul singers led to a consideration of whether a third British Invasion was taking place—this time a soul invasion—in contrast to the 1960s rock and pop, and 1980s new wave and synthpop invasions. It led to the creation of a number of fusions with other forms of music that produced subgenres such as British folk rock, folk punk and folk metal and continues to thrive nationally and in regional scenes, particularly in areas such as Northumbria and Cornwall. The Second British Invasion, which derived from the British Invasion of the US in the 1960s, consisted of music acts from the United Kingdom that became popular in the United States during the early-to-mid 1980s primarily due to the cable music channel MTV. Boy George of Culture Club was a leading figure in the new romantic movement which became a major part in the Second British Invasion of the US. Gaels folk music\nNorthern Irish folk music\nIreland, including Northern Ireland, has vibrant folk traditions. Timeline of British classical music, and its preceding forms\nFolk music\nEach of the four countries of the United Kingdom has its own diverse and distinctive folk music forms. Forms of popular music, including folk music, jazz, rapping/hip hop, pop and rock music, have particularly flourished in Britain since the twentieth century. English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh folk music as well as other British styles of music heavily influenced American music such as American folk music, American march music, old-time, ragtime, blues, country, and bluegrass. British rock bands, most notably Def Leppard and Iron Maiden, also became part of the renewed popularity of British music. Pop music, a term which originated in Britain in the mid-1950s as a description for ""rock and roll and the new youth music styles that it influenced"", was developed by British artists like the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, whom among other British musicians led rock and roll\'s transition into rock music. Welsh folk music\nWales is a Celtic country that features folk music played at twmpathau (communal dances) and gwyl werin (music festivals). Scottish folk music\nScottish folk music includes many kinds of songs, including ballads and laments, sung by a single singer with accompaniment by bagpipes, fiddles or harps. English folk music\nEngland has a long and diverse history of folk music dating back at least to the medieval period and including many forms of music, song and dance. Post-rock era\nIn addition to advancing the scope of rock music, British acts developed avant-funk and neo soul and created acid jazz. Realisation of this led to three folk revivals, one in the late-19th century, one in the mid-20th century and one at the start of the 21st century which keeps folk music as an important sub-culture within society. Perhaps the most famous modern musician from Northern Ireland influenced by folk tradition is Van Morrison. Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock\'s Greatest Guitarists (4th ed.). Many of the top British bands during the 1960s experienced art school during their youth, and espoused an approach based on art and originality—which came to create art rock. Throughout the history of the British Isles, the land that is now the United Kingdom has been a major music producer, drawing inspiration from church music and traditional folk music, using instruments from England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. As a diverging act to the popular pop rock of the early 1960s, the Rolling Stones pioneered the gritty, heavier-driven sound that came to define hard rock. Folk music flourished until the era of industrialisation when it began to be replaced by new forms of popular music, including music hall and brass bands. Rock Criticism from the Beginning: Amusers, Bruisers, and Cool-Headed Cruisers. Progressive rock was predicated on the ""progressive"" pop groups from the 1960s who combined rock and roll with various other music styles such as Indian ragas, oriental melodies and Gregorian chants, like the Beatles and the Yardbirds. Romantic nationalism encouraged clear national identities and sensibilities within the countries of the United Kingdom towards the end of the nineteenth century, producing many composers and musicians of note and drawing on the folk tradition. Brita', 'From British Invasion:\nIn America, the Invasion arguably spelled the end of the popularity of instrumental surf music, pre-Motown vocal girl groups, the folk revival (which adapted by evolving into folk rock), teenage tragedy songs, Nashville country music (which also faced its own crisis with the deaths of some of its biggest stars at the same time), and temporarily, the teen idols that had dominated the United States charts in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The British Invasion also played a major part in the rise of a distinct genre of rock music and cemented the primacy of the rock group, based around guitars and drums and producing their own material as singer-songwriters. Stylistically, the proportions of US music being made did not change substantially during the Invasion, even as the British acts flooded the charts with a homogenous pop-rock sound; folk, country and novelty music, already small factors in the overall pop realm, dropped to near-nonexistence, while girl groups were also hard hit. Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, for example, acknowledged the debt that US artists owed to British musicians, such as the Searchers, but that ""they were using folk music licks that I was using anyway. The musical style of British Invasion artists, such as the Beatles, had been influenced by earlier American rock \'n\' roll, a genre that had lost some popularity and appeal by the time of the Invasion. The emergence of a relatively homogeneous worldwide ""rock"" music style marking the end of the ""invasion"" occurred in 1967. Though many of the acts associated with the invasion did not survive its end, many others would become icons of rock music. It prompted many existing garage rock bands to adopt a sound with a British Invasion inflection and inspired many other groups to form, creating a scene from which many major US acts of the next decade would emerge. In 1978, two rock magazines wrote cover stories analyzing power pop as a saviour to both the new wave and the direct simplicity of rock. Impact on American music\nThe British Invasion had a profound impact on popular music, internationalising the production of rock and roll, establishing the British popular music industry as a viable centre of musical creativity, and opening the door for subsequent British performers to achieve international success. British progressive rock acts of the 1970s were often more popular in the US than their native Britain, as the US working class was generally favourable to the virtuosity of progressive rock acts, while the bands\' British audience was confined to the more genteel upper classes. The British Invasion was a cultural phenomenon of the mid-1960s, when rock and pop music acts from the United Kingdom and other aspects of British culture became popular in the United States with significant influence on the rising ""counterculture"" on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. In summation, he noted that a plurality of the alleged victims of the Invasion (42 percent of most US hit music acts of 1963) were already seeing diminishing returns in 1963 before the Invasion began; 24 percent of US acts that year saw their success continue through the invasion, such as the Beach Boys and Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons; 14 percent were the likes of Sedaka, Vee and Presley in that they suffered during the Invasion but recovered afterward; and 20 percent suffered fatal damage to their careers because of it (with Barnes stating that 7 percent of US acts—mostly Cameo Parkway acts and folk revival groups—were wiped out almost entirely due to the Invasion, and the other 13 percent had the Invasion as one of several reasons for their declines). ""Freakbeat"" is a term sometimes given to certain British Invasion acts closely associated with the Mod scene during the Swinging London period, particularly harder-driving British blues bands of the era that often remained obscure to US listeners, and who are sometimes seen as counterparts to the garage rock bands in America. Background\nThe rebellious tone and image of American rock and roll and blues musicians became popular with British youth in the late 1950s. Fashion\nFashion and image set the Beatles apart from their earlier American rock and roll counterparts.

While early commercial attempts to replicate Ame', 'From Psychedelic rock:\nSeveral California-based folk acts followed the Byrds into folk rock, bringing their psychedelic influences with them, to produce the ""San Francisco Sound"". In the British folk scene, blues, drugs, jazz and Eastern influences blended in the early 1960s work of Davy Graham, who adopted modal guitar tunings to transpose Indian ragas and Celtic reels. According to AllMusic, the emergence of psychedelic rock in the mid-1960s resulted from British groups who made up the British Invasion of the US market and folk rock bands seeking to broaden ""the sonic possibilities of their music"". Pepper English psychedelic groups developed the Beatles\' classical influences further than either the Beatles or contemporaneous West Coast psychedelic bands. American folk singer Bob Dylan\'s influence was central to the creation of the folk rock movement in 1965, and his lyrics remained a touchstone for the psychedelic songwriters of the late 1960s. Original psychedelic era\n1960–65: Precursors and influences\nMusic critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to ""pin down"" the first psychedelic record are ""nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record"". Similarly, folk guitarist Sandy Bull\'s early work ""incorporated elements of folk, jazz, and Indian and Arabic-influenced dronish modes"". In the 1990s, Elephant 6 collective bands such as The Olivia Tremor Control and The Apples in Stereo mixed the genre with lo-fi influences. Following Shin Jung-Hyeon, the band San Ul Lim (Mountain Echo) often combined psychedelic rock with a more folk sound. He co-founded venues including the UFO Club, produced Pink Floyd\'s ""Arnold Layne"", and went on to manage folk and folk rock acts including Nick Drake, the Incredible String Band and Fairport Convention. Psychedelic music also contributed to the origins of glam rock, with Marc Bolan changing his psychedelic folk duo into rock band T. Rex and becoming the first glam rock star from 1970. One of the first musical uses of the term ""psychedelic"" in the folk scene was by the New York-based folk group The Holy Modal Rounders on their version of Lead Belly\'s \'Hesitation Blues\' in 1964. Some of the earlier 1960s psychedelic rock musicians were based in folk, jazz, and the blues, while others showcased an explicit Indian classical influence called ""raga rock"". According to author Edward Macan, there ultimately existed three distinct branches of British psychedelic music. and Faust developed a distinctive brand of electronic rock, known as kosmische musik, or in the British press as ""Kraut rock"". The label was popularised by the British music press in the early 1990s. From 1967 to 1968, it was the prevailing sound of rock music, either in the more whimsical British variant, or the harder American West Coast acid rock. The Yardbirds became the first British band to have the term ""psychedelic"" applied to one of its songs. By this point, many surviving acts had moved away from psychedelia into either more back-to-basics ""roots rock"", traditional-based, pastoral or whimsical folk, the wider experimentation of progressive rock, or riff-based heavy rock. In Unterberger\'s opinion, the Byrds, emerging from the Los Angeles folk rock scene, and the Yardbirds, from England\'s blues scene, were more responsible than the Beatles for ""sounding the psychedelic siren"". In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre: the more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast ""acid rock"". Compared with the American form, British psychedelic music was often more arty in its experimentation, and it tended to stick within pop song structures. Graham was highly influential on Scottish folk virtuoso Bert Jansch and other pioneering guitarists across a spectrum of styles and genres in the mid-1960s. Philo cites ""Rain"" as ""the birth of British psychedelic rock"" and describes Revolver as ""[the] most sustained deployment of Indian instruments, musical form and even religious philosophy"" heard in popular music up to that time. Virtuoso sitarist Ravi Shankar had begun in 1956 a mission to bring Indian classical music to the West, inspiring jazz, classical and folk musicians. Prog, heavy metal, and krautrock\nMany of the British musicians and bands that had embraced psychedelia went on to create progressive rock in the 1970s, including Pink Floyd, Soft Machine and members of Yes. The Incredible String Band\'s The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion (July 1967) developed their folk music into a pastoral form of psychedelia. A major figure in the development of British psychedelia was the American promoter and record producer Joe Boyd, who moved to London in 1966. Other major British Invasion acts who absorbed psychedelia in 1967 include the Hollies with the album Butterfly, and The Rolling Stones album Their Satanic Majesties Request.

At the age of 21, he enrolled as an English major at Middlebury College in Vermont under the G.I. His onscreen wife in Seinfeld was played by his Twin Peaks co-star Grace Zabriskie. Frost died at his home in Middlebury, Vermont, on February 17, 2017, following a long illness at the age of 91. In the Seinfeld TV series he played Henry Ross, father of Susan Ross, George Costanza's fiancée. He is known for television roles on Matlock and Seinfeld, and particularly as Doctor Hayward on Twin Peaks, a series co-created by his son Mark Frost. Warren Frost (June 5, 1925 – February 17, 2017) was an American actor. His work was mainly in theater, but he worked in films and television sporadically from 1958.

After graduation from Harvard, his father\'s alma mater, John worked at Filene\'s Department Store in Boston until America entered World War II in 1941. Career and politics\nAfter the war, Roosevelt pursued a business career in California as the Regional Merchandising Manager for Grayson & Robertson Stores in Los Angeles. Of John Roosevelt\'s activities before World War II, a Roosevelt biographer noted: ""When he was a junior at Harvard, FDR got him a summer job working in the forests of Tennessee for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Roosevelt and his next oldest sibling, Franklin Jr., were much closer to their mother than the three older Roosevelt children had been. World War II\nOn the eve of World War II, alone among the sons, John Roosevelt announced that he would seek conscientious objector status.

Although Roosevelt leaned Republican at an early age, he deliberately kept an apolitical stance until after his father\'s death. Collier, Peter (with David Horowitz): The Roosevelts. James Roosevelt summarized his brother\'s service:\n\nJohn was the only one of us who had no opportunity to lead a fighting unit, yet he, too, served under fire.

In 1937, John Roosevelt was involved in a drunken brawl and an attack on the mayor in Cannes that made headlines across the world. ""The youngest, he was also the least close to father."" Assigned as a lieutenant in the Navy Supply Corps, he persuaded father to get him transferred from shore to sea duty. By family consensus, Roosevelt was the son least like his father, which reflected itself politically as well as in many other aspects. He was five years old when his father Franklin Roosevelt contracted a paralytic illness that confined him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life. Their children were:\n\nHaven Clark Roosevelt (born 1940)\nAnne Sturgis ""Nina"" Roosevelt (born 1942)\nSara Delano ""Sally"" Roosevelt (1946–1960); killed in a horseback-riding accident\nJoan Lindsay Roosevelt (1952–1997)\nIn 1965, John and Anne Roosevelt obtained a divorce. Within three years of Eleanor Roosevelt\'s death, John Roosevelt divorced and remarried. His philanthropic activities included serving as a fund raiser with the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which his father had founded, membership on the executive committee of the Greater New York Council of the Boy Scouts of America and service as a trustee of the State University of New York. She saw John\'s children often and was particularly close to his daughter, Sara ""Sally"" Roosevelt. After Eleanor Roosevelt\'s death, John kept the papers from her Hyde Park home and New York City apartment. Anne moved to Mallorca, Spain, where she lived with Elliott Roosevelt\'s divorced third wife, Faye Emerson. The tension was exacerbated when Roosevelt and his family moved into Stone Cottage next door to Eleanor Roosevelt\'s home at Val-Kill that same year. At Bache, he managed the Teamsters Union pension funds and was a friend and vocal defender of Jimmy Hoffa until the latter\'s incarceration. But in 1952, he went beyond paper registration, actively supporting Dwight D. Eisenhower\'s bid for the Presidency against Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson, for whom his mother was just as actively campaigning. Conscious of her husband\'s disability and determined that the younger children should not miss out on the sports and physical activities that their older siblings had enjoyed, Eleanor Roosevelt learned to swim and skate. In 1947, John Roosevelt changed his political affiliation to Republican, a gesture his mother interpreted as an attempt to win support from his wife\'s family, his father-in-law being a staunchly Republican Boston banker. His defection from the Democratic Party and his subsequent leadership of Citizens for Eisenhower – he vocally defended Eisenhower\'s running mate, California Senator Richard Nixon, against attacks by his mother – caused considerable family friction. At the end of the experience, his supervisor felt compelled to write Eleanor to say that her youngest son seemed to believe in \'the psychology of making one\'s way by influence and association rather than by hard work and personal achievement.\'"" John Aspinwall Roosevelt II (March 13, 1916 – April 27, 1981) was an American businessman and the sixth and last child of U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and his wife, Eleanor Roosevelt. Early life\nJohn Aspinwall Roosevelt II was the youngest child of Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt. His surviving siblings were Anna E. Roosevelt, James Roosevelt II, Elliott Roosevelt, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, Jr. Roosevelt grew up on the Roosevelt estate in Hyde Park, New York and attended preparatory schools The Buckley School and Groton ', 'From Career of Cristiano Ronaldo:\nA key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: ""He\'s been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."" The brace made Ronaldo the oldest player to score two goals in a match in the competition, and the oldest player to score for Portugal at a major tournament. Moreover, he became the oldest player, at the age of 35 years and 166 days, to score over 30 goals in one of the five top European leagues since Ronnie Rooke with Arsenal in 1948. International career\n2001–2004: Youth career\nRonaldo began his international career with Portugal under-15 in 2001. This made him the outright all-time highest assist-provider in the competition since 1968, with seven assists, as well as the oldest player ever to assist a goal in the competition at 39 years. On 14 October, he scored his 700th senior career goal for club and country from the penalty spot, in his 974th senior career appearance, a 2–1 away loss to Ukraine in a Euro 2020 qualifier. In the opening match against the Czech Republic, on 18 June, he became the first player to appear at six European Championships, and in doing so at the age of 39, he became the second oldest outfield player in the competition\'s history, only behind his teammate Pepe, who achieved his record on the same day. On 15 June 2018, Ronaldo became the oldest player to score a hat-trick in a FIFA World Cup match, helping Portugal secure a 3–3 draw against Spain (his third goal a 30-yard curling free kick with two minutes remaining) in their opening match. Two goals against Malmö FF in a 2–0 away win on 30 September saw him reach the milestone of 500 career goals for club and country. On 8 December, Ronaldo made his 1200th senior career appearance for club and country, scoring the first goal of a 4–1 win over Al-Riyadh. Ronaldo took part in the tournament despite suffering from patellar tendinitis and a related thigh injury, potentially risking his career. He became the first player to reach 900 career goals. He received the 2013 FIFA Ballon d\'Or, an amalgamation of the Ballon d\'Or and the FIFA World Player of the Year award, for the first time in his career. On 9 October, Ronaldo came on as a substitute and scored his 700th career club goal in a 2–1 win against Everton. He was awarded the Silver Boot as the joint second-highest goalscorer, with three goals and three assists, and was named to the team of the tournament for the third time in his career. In recognition of his record-breaking goalscoring success, Ronaldo received special awards for Outstanding Career Achievement by FIFA in 2021 and Champions League All-Time Top Scorer by UEFA in 2024. During his international youth career, Ronaldo would represent the under-15, under-17, under-20, under-21 and under-23 national sides, amassing 34 youth caps and scoring 18 goals overall. His 56th career hat-trick, he became only the second player after Alexis Sánchez to score hat-tricks in the Premier League, La Liga and Serie A. On 14 March, he scored his 57th career hat-trick in a 3–1 away win over Cagliari. His 54 goals was the most goals he had scored in a calendar year since 2016, and sixth time he achieved that feat in his career (2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2023). On 18 March, he reached his 50th career hat-trick, scoring four goals in a 6–3 win against Girona. On 15 December, Ronaldo scored his 500th club career goal in the 2–0 win over Club América in the semi-finals of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup. On 9 February, Ronaldo scored all four goals in a 4–0 win over Al-Wehda, his first goal of the match being his 500th career league goal. On 2 September, he scored a goal in Al-Nassr\'s 5–1 away win against Al-Hazem, his 850th senior career goal. On 4 May, he clinched his 66th career hat-trick in a 6–0 victory over Al-Wehda, notching his 890th goal overall. On 5 April, he scored five goals in a game for the first time in his career, including an eight-minute hat-trick, in a 9–1 rout of Granada. On 11 March, Ronaldo became the first football player to achieve 800 career wins following a match against Al-Ain in the second leg of the AFC Champions League quarter-finals. On 2 December, he scored a goal against Dynamo Kyiv in a Champions League group stage match, his 750th senior career goal. On 2 December, Ronaldo netted two goals in a 3–2 home league win against Arsenal, which saw him surpass 800 career goals. On 19 September, Ronaldo made his AFC Champions League debut, starting in a 2–0 win over Persepolis, becoming the first player in football history to record 1000 career games unbeaten (776 wins and 224 draws). Following a hamstring injury, which saw him miss the Manchester derby against Manchester City, Ronaldo made his return from injury on 12 March, scoring a hat-trick in a 3–2 victory against Tottenham Hotspur, which saw him pass Josef Bican\'s record for goals scored in professional football with 807 career goals, although the Football Asso', ""From List of oldest and youngest NBA players:\nAll-time\nActive\nSee also\nNBA records\nList of National Basketball Association career games played leaders\nList of National Basketball Association seasons played leaders\nList of oldest professional athletes by sport\nList of oldest Major League Baseball players\nList of oldest National Hockey League players\n\nReferences\nGeneral\n\nSpecific This is a list of oldest and youngest National Basketball Association players.

Following the retirements of Udonis Haslem and Andre Iguodala shortly after the 2022–23 season, the oldest active player is LeBron James. Key\nOldest players\nThe oldest player ever to play in the NBA was Nat Hickey who played one game in the 1947–48 season when he was 45 years and 363 days old. The oldest active player is LeBron James, who is currently 39 years, 353 days old. When the Bulls won the 1997 Finals, Parish became the oldest player ever to win the NBA championship. He played for the Detroit Pistons in Game 3 of the 2004 Finals at the age of 18 years and 356 days old. The oldest person ever to play in the NBA was Nat Hickey, a coach who activated himself as a player for a game two days before his 46th birthday. Nineteen of them came to the league straight out of high school, while eight of them are international players who never played basketball in U.S. high schools or colleges before they entered the NBA, and four players, Devin Booker, Joshua Primo, Jalen Duren and GG Jackson played one year of college before entering the NBA all while remaining 18 years old throughout the process. In 2005, the league and the players' union agreed on a new collective bargaining agreement that includes a minimum age limit which requires that players who wish to enter the league must be at least 19 years old on December 31 of the year of the draft, and at least one year removed from high school. The youngest player to ever play in the NBA was Andrew Bynum who played his first game at the age of 18 years and 6 days old. Jermaine O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, both drafted in 1996, were the second- and third-youngest players. In his first game as a player for the Steamrollers, he missed all six of his shot attempts and only scored two points from three free throw attempts; he only played in one more game before retiring as a player two days shy of his 46th birthday. In the 1970s, the league began to allow college underclassmen and high school players to enter the league. Hickey, who was coaching the Providence Steamrollers at the time, decided to activate himself and played in a game for the Steamrollers. The third-oldest player is Hall of Famer Robert Parish. The Pistons won the 2004 Finals and Miličić became the youngest player ever to win the NBA championship, being only five days away from his 19th birthday at the time. Willis then played five games for the Mavericks at the age of 44. However, the trend of drafting high school players only began in the mid-1990s. The NBA was founded in 1946 as the Basketball Association of America (BAA). The second-oldest player is Kevin Willis, who played 20 seasons (excluding the 1988–89 season he missed due to injury) in the league before he sat out the 2005–06 season and earned a contract with the Dallas Mavericks on April 2, 2007. The league adopted its current name at the start of the 1949–50 season when it merged with the National Basketball League (NBL). Bynum, who was also the youngest player ever selected in the NBA Draft, went into the NBA straight out of high school. Parish, who played with the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, played his last season with the Chicago Bulls at the age of 43. The National Basketball Association (NBA) is a men's professional basketball league in North America. The youngest player ever to play in the NBA was Andrew Bynum, who played his first game only six days after his 18th birthday. He is the only active player who was born before 1985. The youngest active player in the NBA is Toronto Raptors center Ulrich Chomche, the 57th overall pick in the 2024 NBA draft, who was born on December 30, 2005. There are 31 players who played in the NBA after they turned 40. All-time\nActive\nThis list includes active players who are or will be at least 35 years old in the current season or year. Youngest players\nNBA players usually come from U.S. college basketball. In the past, a college player had to complete his four-year college eligibility before he could enter the league through the NBA draft or as a free agent. This has led to more younger players entering the league directly after high school graduation. International players who did not play college basketball also have to be at least 19 years old on the same date to be able to play in the NBA. Despite a trend toward drafting younger players, the NBA has a higher average age than it had in the 1980s. However, since the NBA introduced the minimum age limit in 2005, the league's average age ha""]",professional wrestler,"The provided context does not mention any information about the career shared by an oldest father, or a man who killed his wife and son.

GamesRadar named Veilguard the Best RPG of 2024 and the third-best game of the year. Marketing\nDragon Age 4 was announced at The Game Awards in December 2018. In August 2023, BioWare laid off 50 people working on Veilguard and the next Mass Effect game; this included Mary Kirby who was one of the series\' original writers and credited with ""creating Varric and the Qunari"". For 2024\'s Dragon Age Day, BioWare released a free standalone version of Veilguard\'s character creator on PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S; players are able to transfer their Rook iterations to the full game after purchase. The Associated Press elected Veilguard as the fourth best video game of 2024. BioWare explained that the titular Dreadwolf remains part of the game, however, the updated title is a stronger reflection of the game\'s focus. In June 2024, the game was retitled Dragon Age: The Veilguard. A tie-in fantasy podcast titled Dragon Age: Vows & Vengeance was released weekly from August 29 to October 17, 2024. Like the choice of origin in the original game, this faction sets the character\'s course throughout the game. Alyssa Mora of IGN emphasized the character creator\'s ""body diversity"" where ""the options feel almost endless"". It was intended to be a smaller, more narrative-focused game set in the Tevinter Imperium region of the game\'s world setting, Thedas. Todd Harper of Polygon emphasized the companions as the heart of the game, noting that they were ""weird and idiosyncratic in the best ways"". They found the lack of a fictional etymology connecting the word to the cultures of Thedas problematic, reflecting wider story issues as the game seems ""barely interested in the politics of its own setting"". The game was announced as Dragon Age: Dreadwolf in 2022, and retitled to Dragon Age: The Veilguard in June 2024. Parrish, now for The Verge, highlighted that the title reveal for the game was ""exciting for a lot of fans"" because it not only makes Solas the antagonist of the upcoming game but also makes Dreadwolf a direct sequel unlike previous installments in the franchise. In March 2023, Darrah returned as a consultant for the game and the Mass Effect team joined the production of Veilguard, according to EA. Veilguard generally received praise for its inclusive character creator and representation of transgender and non-binary characters. Set ten years after Inquisition, the game features new locations in the fictional world of Thedas for the player to explore. Accolades\nVeilguard ranked first on Time\'s ""The 10 Best Video Games of 2024"" list. According to Bloomberg News, after the success of the single-player game Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and the decision to cancel the reworking of the massively multiplayer online Anthem in February 2021 following its lackluster launch, EA and BioWare decided to remove the planned multiplayer components from Morrison and to develop it as a single-player game only. Rescuing Neve, the team locate Solas in the forest of Arlathan, capital of the ancient elven empire. Promotional material showed red lyrium (a corrupted power source of magic in the game\'s universe) and the character Solas – the Dread Wolf – as significant elements of the game\'s plot. Polo explained that while the anthology is a ""great portrait"" of the ""relevant"" Dragon Age canon before the game, the caveat with Tevinter Nights is ""that some of the details set down in it may have changed between 2020 and"" the release of Veilguard. The protagonist player character is ""Rook"", a member of one of six factions: the Antivan Crows, an order of assassins from Antiva; the Grey Wardens, an order dedicated to fighting darkspawn with their headquarters in the Anderfels; the Lords of Fortune, a guild of treasure hunters from Rivain; the Mourn Watch, guardians of the Grand Necropolis in Nevarra; the Shadow Dragons, a Tevinter resistance faction opposing corruption and slavery; or the Veil Jumpers, a multi-race group dedicated to uncovering the forest of Arlathan which was once the capital of the ancient elven empire. :\u200a38\n\nSynopsis\nSetting\nThe story begins ten years after the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, with previous companion Solas, now known by his previous alias, Fen\'Harel, the elven god of betrayal and rebellion, attempting to destroy the Veil, the metaphysical boundary between the physical world and the Fade, the world of spirits and demons; Solas previously created the Veil to imprison the other elven gods after their misuse of power, but now attempts to restore the world of ancient elves out of regret for sealing ancient elves off from the Fade and causing the downfall of their society.

Prize\nDifferent organisations are responsible for awarding the individual prizes; the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awards the Prizes in Physics, Chemistry, and Economics; the Swedish Academy awards the Prize in Literature; the Karolinska Institute awards the Prize in Physiology or Medicine; and the Norwegian Nobel Committee awards the Prize in Peace. The Nobel Prizes (Swedish: Nobelpriset, Norwegian: Nobelprisen) are awarded annually by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the Swedish Academy, the Karolinska Institutet, and the Norwegian Nobel Committee to individuals and organizations who make outstanding contributions in the fields of chemistry, physics, literature, peace, and physiology or medicine. Adolf Hitler forbade four Germans, Richard Kuhn (Chemistry, 1938), Adolf Butenandt (Chemistry, 1939), Gerhard Domagk (Physiology or Medicine, 1939) and Carl von Ossietzky (Peace, 1936) from accepting their Nobel Prizes. Six Nobel laureates were not permitted by their governments to accept the Nobel Prize. Among the 892 Nobel laureates, 48 have been women; the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize was Marie Curie, who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903. They were established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel, which dictates that the awards should be administered by the Nobel Foundation. Also the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Bardeen twice, as was the Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Frederick Sanger and Karl Barry Sharpless. UNHCR has been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize twice. The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World War II. After fifty years, the database of nominations maintained by the Nobel Committee is made available to the public. The awards are presented in Stockholm in an annual ceremony on December 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death. Liu Xiaobo, Carl von Ossietzky and Aung San Suu Kyi were all awarded their Nobel Prize while in prison or detention. With some receiving the Nobel Prize more than once, this makes a total of 892 individuals (including 844 men, 48 women) and 24 organizations. Each recipient, a Nobelist or laureate, receives a gold medal, a diploma, and a sum of money which is decided annually by the Nobel Foundation. An additional prize in memory of Alfred Nobel was established in 1968 by the Sveriges Riksbank (Sweden's central bank) for outstanding contributions to the field of economics. In years in which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to external events or a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize. Seven laureates have received more than one prize; of the seven, the International Committee of the Red Cross has received the Nobel Peace Prize three times, more than any other. The Chinese government forbade Liu Xiaobo from accepting his Nobel Prize (Peace, 2010) and the government of the Soviet Union pressured Boris Pasternak (Literature, 1958) to decline his award. Statutes of the Nobel Foundation, § 10, states:A prize-awarding body may, however, after due consideration in each individual case, permit access to material which formed the basis for the evaluation and decision concerning a prize, for purposes of research in intellectual history. Two Nobel laureates, Jean-Paul Sartre (Literature, 1964) and Lê Ðức Thọ (Peace, 1973), declined the award; Sartre declined the award as he declined all official honors, and Thọ declined the award due to the situation Vietnam was in at the time. Each recipient receives a medal, a diploma and a monetary award that has varied throughout the years. In 2017, the laureates were awarded a prize amount of 9 million SEK.

In the 1950s, Grumman began production of Gulfstream business aircraft, starting with the Gulfstream I turboprop (Grumman model G-159) and the Gulfstream II jet (Grumman model G-1159). Grumman and three other ex-Loening Aircraft employees, (Edmund Ward Poor, William Schwendler, and Jake Swirbul) started their own company in an old Cox-Klemin Aircraft Co. factory in Baldwin on Long Island, New York. At its peak in 1986 it employed 23,000 people on Long Island and occupied 6,000,000 square feet (560,000 m2) in structures on 105 acres (0.42 km2) it leased from the U.S. Navy in Bethpage. The Gulfstream I-C (Grumman model G-159C) version was ""stretched"" to carry 37 passengers. During World War II, Grumman became known for its ""Cats"" (Navy fighter aircraft): the F4F Wildcat and F6F Hellcat, the  Grumman F7F Tigercat and Grumman F8F Bearcat, and also for its torpedo bomber, the Grumman TBF Avenger.

Since 1999, Gulfstream has been a wholly owned subsidiary of General Dynamics. As the company grew, it moved to Valley Stream, New York, then Farmingdale, New York, finally to its facility in Bethpage, New York, with the testing and final assembly at the 6,000-acre (24 km2) Naval Weapons Station in Calverton, New York, all located on Long Island. In 1983, Grumman sold Flxible for $40 million to General Automotive Corporation of Ann Arbor. Grumman was the chief contractor on the Apollo Lunar Module, the first spacecraft to land humans on the Moon. Six of them successfully landed on the Moon, with one serving as a lifeboat on Apollo 13, after an explosion crippled the main Apollo spacecraft. The Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation, later Grumman Aerospace Corporation, was a 20th century American producer of military and civilian aircraft. Founded on December 6, 1929, by Leroy Grumman and his business partners, it merged in 1994 with Northrop Corporation to form Northrop Grumman. History\nLeroy Grumman worked for the Loening Aircraft Engineering Corporation beginning in 1920. In 1929, Keystone Aircraft Corporation bought Loening Aircraft and moved its operations from New York City to Bristol, Pennsylvania. The company registered as a business on December 6, 1929, and officially opened on January 2, 1930. While maintaining the business by welding aluminum tubing for truck frames, the company eagerly pursued contracts with the US Navy. Grumman designed the first practical floats with a retractable landing gear for the Navy, and this launched Grumman into the aviation market. The first Grumman aircraft was also for the Navy, the Grumman FF-1, a biplane with retractable landing gear developed at Curtiss Field in 1931. This was followed by a number of other successful designs. Grumman ranked 22nd among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts. Grumman\'s first jet aircraft was the F9F Panther; it was followed by the upgraded F9F/F-9 Cougar, and the F-11 Tiger in the 1950s. The company\'s big postwar successes came in the 1960s with the A-6 Intruder and E-2 Hawkeye and in the 1970s with the Grumman EA-6B Prowler and F-14 Tomcat. Grumman products were prominent in several feature movies including The Final Countdown in 1980, Top Gun in 1986, and Flight of the Intruder in 1990. The U.S. Navy still employs the Hawkeye as part of Carrier Air Wings on board aircraft carriers, while the U.S. Marine Corps, the last branch of service to fly the Prowler, retired it on March 8, 2019. The firm received the contract on November 7, 1962, and built 13 lunar modules. LM-2, a test article which never flew in space, is displayed permanently in the Smithsonian Institution. As the Apollo program neared its end, Grumman was one of the main competitors for the contract to design and build the Space Shuttle, but lost to Rockwe', 'From Apollo 11:\nAfter the Apollo 11 mission, officials from the Soviet Union said landing humans on the Moon was dangerous and unnecessary. Many nations honored the first human Moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing Apollo 11 commemorative postage stamps or coins. If the computer hadn\'t recognized this problem and taken recovery action, I doubt if Apollo 11 would have been the successful Moon landing it was. The John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum set up an Adobe Flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of Apollo 11 from launch to landing on the Moon. Ken Mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with Anders as backup CMP in case Apollo 11 was delayed past its intended July launch date, at which point Anders would be unavailable. Each display included Moon dust from Apollo 11 and flags, including one of the Soviet Union, taken along by Apollo 11. On July 19, 2019, the Google Doodle paid tribute to the Apollo 11 Moon Landing, complete with a link to an animated YouTube video with voiceover by astronaut Michael Collins. Preparations\nInsignia\nThe Apollo 11 mission emblem was designed by Collins, who wanted a symbol for ""peaceful lunar landing by the United States"". By July 1969, all was in readiness for Apollo 11 to take the final step onto the Moon. In Mission Control during the Apollo 11 landing, Kennedy\'s speech flashed on the screen, followed by the words ""TASK ACCOMPLISHED, July 1969"". The Apollo programme is arguably the greatest technical achievement of mankind to date ... nothing since Apollo has come close [to] the excitement that was generated by those astronauts—Armstrong, Aldrin and the 10 others who followed them.

The requirement for the Sun angle was particularly restrictive, limiting the launch date to one day per month. In July 2010, air-to-ground voice recordings and film footage shot in Mission Control during the Apollo 11 powered descent and landing was re-synchronized and released for the first time. On July 19 at 17:21:50 UTC, Apollo 11 passed behind the Moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit. Apollo 11 effectively proved U.S. victory in the Space Race to demonstrate spaceflight superiority, by fulfilling a national goal proposed in 1961 by President John F.

Radio station recordings (airchecks) covering the flight of Apollo 11. Site selection\nNASA\'s Apollo Site Selection Board announced five potential landing sites on February 8, 1968. Nixon gave the Apollo 11', 'From Apollo 12:\nPreparation\nSite selection\nThe landing site selection process for Apollo 12 was greatly informed by the site selection for Apollo 11. The training schedule was complete, as planned, by November 1, 1969; activities after that date were intended as refreshers. The need for three days to recycle if a launch had to be scrubbed meant that only three of the five suitable sites found were designated as potential landing sites for Apollo 11, of which the Apollo 11 landing site in the Sea of Tranquility was the easternmost. After the mission, samples from Head allowed geologists to date the impact that formed Copernicus—according to initial dating, some 810,000,000 years ago. Since Apollo 12 was to attempt the first lunar landing if Apollo 11 failed, both sets of astronauts trained for the same sites. To improve the quality of television pictures from the Moon, a color camera was carried on Apollo 12 (unlike the monochrome camera on Apollo 11). The Apollo 12 landing area on the Moon is within the portion of the lunar surface shown on the insignia, based on a photograph of a globe of the Moon, taken by engineers. See also\nList of artificial objects on the Moon\nList of missions to the Moon\nList of spacewalks and moonwalks 1965–1999\n\nReferences\nBibliography\nExternal links\n""Apollo 12"" at Encyclopedia Astronautica\n""Apollo 12"" at NASA\'s National Space Science Data Center\nApollo 11, 12, and 14 Traverses, at the Lunar and Planetary Institute\n""Apollo 12 Traverse Map"" at the USGS Astrogeology Science Center\nLunar Orbiter 3 image 154 H2, used for planning the mission (landing site is left of center). Apollo 12 would have attempted the first lunar landing had Apollo 11 failed, but after the success of the earlier mission, Apollo 12 was postponed by two months, and other Apollo missions also put on a more relaxed schedule. Two hammocks were added for greater comfort of the astronauts while resting on the Moon, and a color television camera substituted for the black and white one used on the lunar surface during Apollo 11. As Apollo 11 was targeted for an ellipse-shaped landing zone, rather than at a specific point, there was no planning for geology traverses, the designated tasks to be done at sites of the crew\'s choosing. Under control from Earth, the LM\'s remaining propellant was depleted in a burn that caused it to impact the Moon 39 nautical miles (72 km; 45 mi) from the Apollo 12 landing point. Had the mission been postponed, it could have been launched on November 16 with landing at a backup site where there would be no Surveyor, but since time pressure to achieve a lunar landing had been removed by Apollo 11\'s success, NASA might have waited until December for the next opportunity to go to the Surveyor crater. Lunar orbit and Moon landing\nApollo 12 entered a lunar orbit of 170.2 by 61.66 nautical miles (315.2 by 114.2 km; 195.9 by 70.96 mi) with an SPS burn of 352.25 seconds at mission time 83:25:26.36. This was at the start of a launch window of three hours and four minutes to reach the Moon with optimal lighting conditions at the planned landing point. To practice landing on the Moon, Conrad flew the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle (LLTV), training in which continued to be authorized even though Armstrong had been forced to bail out of a similar vehicle in 1968, just before it crashed. Apollo 12\'s spacecraft and launch vehicle were almost identical to Apollo 11\'s. After the return of Apollo 11 in July 1969, more time was allotted for geology, but the astronauts\' focus was on getting time in the simulators without being preempted by the Apollo 11 crew. Gaseous hydrogen in the water had given the Apollo 11 crew severe flatulence. The differences between the CSM and LM of Apollo 11, and those of Apollo 12, were few and minor. Among the sites studied were contemplated landing points for future Apollo missions. Conrad and Bean received more mission-specific training than Apollo 11\'s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin had. After the return of Apollo 11, the Apollo 12 crew was able to view the lunar samples, and be briefed on them by scientists. Hardware\nLaunch vehicle\nThere were no significant changes to the Saturn V launch vehicle used on Apollo 12, SA–507, from that used on Apollo 11. The SLA was identical to Apollo 11\'s, while the LES differed only in the installation of a more reliable motor igniter. It for example allowed Apollo 12 to launch in daylight and reach the planned landing spot on schedule. The S-IVBs used on later lunar missions were deliberately crashed into the Moon to create seismic events that would register on the seismometers left on the Moon and provide data about the Moon\'s structure. Gordon, though, still hoped to walk on the Moon and remained with the Apollo program, serving as backup commander of Apollo 15. More time was allotted for geologic training in preparation for Apollo 12 than for Apollo 11, Conrad and Bean making several geology field trips in preparation for their mission. With the success of A', ""From Vauxhall Motors:\nIt was acquired by American automaker General Motors (GM) in 1925. The Cavalier nameplate was discontinued in 1995 after 20 years, a full model after Opel had dropped its Ascona nameplate, Vauxhall adopting the common Vectra nameplate for its successor, completing a policy by General Motors that aligned and identically badged all Vauxhall and Opel models. On 1 June 2009, Vauxhall Motors' troubled parent company, General Motors, filed for bankruptcy in a court in New York. Vauxhall became a subsidiary of Stellantis in January 2021, having previously been owned by General Motors since 1925. It was a luxury car brand until it was bought by General Motors, who thereafter built mid-market offerings. 1925 to 1945\nOn 16 November 1925, Vauxhall was acquired by General Motors for US$2.5 million. On 18 September 2017, Vauxhall's official company name was changed from General Motors UK Limited, in use since 16 April 2008, back to its original Vauxhall Motors Limited. GM Europe then began to standardise model names across both brands in the early 1990s. HydroGen4 is the successor of the fuel-cell vehicle Opel HydroGen3, developed by General Motors/Opel and presented in 2007 at the IAA in Frankfurt and was expected to hit the market in 2016. The model was also sold in left-hand drive form by General Motors in Canada (under the specially-created Envoy name and under the original Vauxhall Victor name through Pontiac dealerships in the USA. The VXR badge was intended to be a symbol of the combined technological resources of the global General Motors group, and the recognised expertise of consultants Lotus and the Triple Eight Racing Team. On 3 November 2009, the GM board called off the Magna deal after coming to the conclusion that Opel and Vauxhall Motors was crucial to GM's global strategy. 2017–present\nOn 3 March 2017, sources revealed that the American group General Motors had reached a tentative agreement with Groupe PSA for the acquisition of the Vauxhall and Opel brands and the complete Vauxhall/Opel automobile business. By then, the sale of Vauxhall and its German sister subsidiary, Opel, was being negotiated as part of a strategy driven by the German government to ring fence the businesses from any General Motors asset liquidation. Apart from the VX220, sold by Opel as the Speedster, all of Vauxhall's subsequent models have had the same names as those of Opel. General Motors continued to reposition Vauxhall towards the middle of the British car market, aiming to produce higher volumes of more conventional cars that, using GM's large engineering, design and production resources, would offer modern technology and high levels of equipment at a reasonable price with competitors being the likes of Wolseley and Humber. Imports of this vehicle were limited to 15,000 to avoid additional safety testing. Vauxhall's original car plant in Luton stood next to the commercial vehicle plant. Vauxhall is one of the oldest established vehicle manufacturers and distribution companies in the United Kingdom. Vauxhall Motors Limited is a British car company headquartered in Chalton, Bedfordshire, England. Vauxhall also added another vehicle to its four-wheel drive line-up in the shape of the Isuzu-based Monterey. From 1942 to 1987 Vauxhall operated a truck and bus vehicle assembly plant in Dunstable, Bedfordshire. Much of Vauxhall's success during the early years of Vauxhall Motors was attributable to Laurence Pomeroy. Many police forces across the United Kingdom adopted the Astra as the standard patrol vehicle (panda car). After production ceased there in 2002, the plant was demolished and, after several proposals for redevelopment, permission was granted for the site to be redeveloped as the Napier Park in January 2014. In 1967, Vauxhall became a Royal Warrant Holder: Motor Vehicle Manufacturers to HM The Queen – the Royal Mews. Bedford Vehicles had been Vauxhall's commercial vehicle arm, making successful vans, trucks, and lorries since the 1930s. Sponsorships\nVauxhall Motors sponsored the Football Conference, the highest non-league division of English football, from 1986 until 1998. After 92 years under GM's ownership, Opel/Vauxhall was sold to Groupe PSA in 2017. After the 1918 armistice, the D-type remained in production, along with the sporting E-type. After 15 months on sale the AS-type Light Six was replaced by the D-type Light Six. After the banning of Group B in 1986 the Group A Astra returned to the forefront. The British government had also revoked the RAC taxable horsepower system and replaced it with a flat charge per vehicle regardless of engine size. The company continued to trade under the name Vauxhall Iron Works until 1907, when the modern name 'Vauxhall Motors' was adopted. Also in 2004, production of the Frontera ended after 13 years, with no direct replacement. The Vectra brought success back to Vauxhall after Fabrizio Giovanardi won the 2007 and 2008 BTCC championship.

Brady was awarded Super Bowl MVP for the game. He was the oldest NFL MVP at age 40, the oldest Super Bowl MVP at age 43, and the oldest quarterback selected to the Pro Bowl at age 44. He is the NFL leader in career quarterback wins, quarterback regular season wins, quarterback playoff wins, and Super Bowl Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, and the only Super Bowl MVP for two different franchises. He was named Super Bowl MVP for the third time, tying Montana\'s record. Brady extended his record for most Super Bowl wins by a player with his seventh and extended his record for Super Bowl MVP awards, with five. In his seven victories, Brady set the record for Super Bowl MVP awards with five. Brady is the NFL\'s oldest quarterback to be named to the Pro Bowl (age 44), be named Super Bowl MVP (43), win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback (43), and be named league MVP (40). In Super Bowl XXXVIII, Brady led the Patriots to a 32–29 victory over the NFC champion Carolina Panthers and was named Super Bowl MVP for the second time. Brady was named Super Bowl MVP while throwing for 145 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions. In addition, Brady set another record by winning his fourth Super Bowl MVP award for his clutch performance. Brady became the second quarterback, joining Peyton Manning, to lead two different teams to Super Bowl wins, but the first to win Super Bowl MVP with two different teams. Super Bowl LV was the first title game where both starting quarterbacks, Brady and his opposing counterpart Patrick Mahomes, have won the AP NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards; as Brady is Mahomes\' senior by 18 years, some billed the matchup as comparable to Michael Jordan versus LeBron James. With the win, Brady became the oldest quarterback in Super Bowl history to start, play, win, and receive the MVP award. Having earned Super Bowl MVP honors with both New England and Tampa Bay, Brady is the only player to win the award with multiple franchises. 2017–2019: Final years in New England\n2017: Third MVP and loss in Super Bowl LII\nOn May 12, 2017, Brady was announced as the cover athlete for Madden NFL 18. Additional accolades held by Brady include the most Pro Bowl selections and the first unanimous NFL MVP. In Super Bowl XLVI, Brady and the Patriots met the Giants in a rematch of Super Bowl XLII, which the Giants won 21–17. With the victory, Brady won his fifth Super Bowl, which set a record for most Super Bowl victories of any quarterback in history and tied defensive player Charles Haley for the most Super Bowl victories for any player. However, after his wife was asked directly on Instagram whether she and Brady backed Trump, Bündchen answered ""NO!"" This was followed by Brady making three consecutive Super Bowl appearances from 2016 to 2018, which secured New England\'s fifth and sixth titles in Super Bowl LI and Super Bowl LIII. After a 45–7 blowout of the Colts, Brady advanced to play in his sixth Super Bowl, breaking a tie with John Elway for most career Super Bowl appearances by a quarterback. He became the starting quarterback during his second season, which saw the Patriots win their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVI. He joined the Buccaneers in 2020 and won Super Bowl LV, extending his individual records to 10 Super Bowl appearances and seven victories. In 2023, it was reported Tom Brady owned 1,144,861 common shares in FTX, and he and his wife lost an estimated combined value of $45 million when FTX went bankrupt. 2014–2016: Return to Super Bowl success and Deflategate\n2014: Fourth Super Bowl win\nBrady started the 2014 season with a 33–20 loss to the Dolphins. Brady has the most Pro Bowl selections in NFL history at 15 and was named league MVP three times in 2007, 2010 and 2017. Brady\'s 37 completed passes in the game set a Super Bowl record at the time, which Brady himself would break in Super Bowl LI two years later. The win gave Brady his record-extending tenth Super Bowl appearance, making Brady the fourth quarterback to lead two different teams to the Super Bowl, joining Craig Morton, Kurt Warner, and Peyton Manning, and the second after Morton to reach the Super Bowl from both conferences. This resulted in the first overtime in Super Bowl history. The Rams later went on to win Super Bowl LVI. In Super Bowl LIII, Brady completed 21-of-35 passes for 262 passing yards and an interception as the Patriots won 13–3 over the Rams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history. This was the third time overall that Brady had lost in a Super Bowl, becoming the fourth starting quarterback in Super Bowl history to lose at least three Super Bowls joining Jim Kelly, Fran Tarkenton, and John Elway. He was named to his 11th Pro Bowl (seventh straight), and was ranked as the second best player on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016 behind only league MVP Cam Newton.

For his performance, Warner was awarded the Super Bowl MVP award. Considered the NFL\'s greatest undrafted player, Warner is the only undrafted player to be named NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP and the only undrafted quarterback to lead his team to a Super Bowl victory. During his first season as an NFL starting quarterback, Warner led The Greatest Show on Turf offense to the Rams\' first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXIV, earning him league and Super Bowl MVP honors. He won his second league MVP award two years later en route to an appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI. His career, which saw him ascend from an undrafted free agent to a two-time Most Valuable Player and Super Bowl MVP, is widely regarded as one of the greatest Cinderella stories in NFL history. He led Arizona during the 2008 season to Super Bowl XLIII, the franchise\'s first Super Bowl appearance. In Warner\'s third career Super Bowl appearance on February 1, the Cardinals lost Super Bowl XLIII 27–23 to the Pittsburgh Steelers, leaving him with a career 1–2 record in Super Bowls.

He was also the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl during his first season as the primary starter. Warner is one of four quarterbacks who made Super Bowl starts with two teams (alongside Craig Morton, Peyton Manning, and Tom Brady). Nine years later, upon leading the Cardinals to the franchise\'s first-ever Super Bowl, Warner\'s response was similar:\n\nTerry Bradshaw from Fox: ""You\'re not going to like this, but you\'re the third oldest quarterback to ever play in the Super Bowl. He said he was looking forward to finally being a true father to his seven kids, and that he wanted to spend time with his wife. In the NFL playoffs, Warner ultimately led the Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV against the Tennessee Titans. Warner has devoted time and money to his First Things First Foundation, the name of which was derived from his interview after winning the Super Bowl in 1999. 2001 season\nWarner returned to MVP form in 2001. Warner took his team to the Super Bowl every year that he played as the starting quarterback during all regular and post season games. Warner\'s work both on and off the field resulted in him being awarded the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award 2008, which was presented to him at the start of Super Bowl XLIII. In Super Bowl XXXVI, Warner threw for 365 yards (then the second-highest, now the sixth-highest total in Super Bowl history) and a passing touchdown along with a rushing touchdown, but his rhythm was disrupted by New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick\'s defensive game plan and he tossed two costly interceptions which helped stake the heavy-underdog Patriots to a two-touchdown lead. The game ended in a 20–17 loss for Warner and the Rams when Patriots kicker Adam Vinatieri kicked a game-winning field goal as time expired, giving the Patriots the first of three Super Bowl wins in four years. Warner had thus recorded the three highest single-game passing yardage totals in Super Bowl history up to that point, and joined Roger Staubach, Terry Bradshaw, Joe Montana, John Elway, and Tom Brady as the only quarterbacks to throw a touchdown pass in three Super Bowls. On January 18, Warner threw for 279 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions against the Philadelphia Eagles to lead the Cardinals to their first Super Bowl appearance in history. Warner was also named the NFL MVP for the second time in three seasons, giving the Rams their third winner in as many years (running back Mar', ""From Capital Cities/ABC:\nThat station, which switched its affiliation from NBC to ABC, was purchased by Capital Cities/ABC in 1995, and was completed just before Disney's acquisition of the combined group was finalized.

In May 1991, Capital Cities/ABC's Farm Progress Cos. closed its purchase of Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc.'s 12-magazine farm publishing group. Network Group president Bob Iger was also promoted to executive president of CC/ABC. Capital Cities then began purchasing stations, starting with WPRO-AM-FM-TV in Providence, Rhode Island (another capital city) in 1959. It was eventually acquired by The Walt Disney Company and re-branded itself as Disney–ABC Television Group (now Disney General Entertainment Content) in 1996. Returning to broadcasting, WBIE-FM (now WKHX-FM) in Marietta, Georgia (near Atlanta, another capital city), was bought in 1981. The Kansas City (Missouri) Star was acquired in 1977, and the following year CapCities bought Times Leader of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. In the late fall of 1954, a group of New York City-based investors, led by famous radio broadcaster and author Lowell Thomas, bought majority control of Hudson Valley Broadcasting from Rosenblum and associates. WTNH would have been sold in any event due to a significant signal overlap with ABC flagship WABC-TV in New York City. Citing CBS' ownership of television stations in New York City (WCBS-TV) and Philadelphia (at the time WCAU-TV) under grandfathered status, Capital Cities/ABC requested, and was granted a permanent waiver from the FCC allowing it to keep WPVI-TV.

On the radio side, new owners were found for CapCities' WPAT stations (Park Communications was the buyer), WKBW (Price Communications, the new owner, changed its call letters to WWKB, which was necessitated due to an FCC regulation in effect then that forbade TV and radio stations in the same city, but with different owners from sharing the same call letters) and KLAC and KZLA-FM (to Malrite Communications), and ABC's WRIF-FM in Detroit (to a minority-owned concern), among others. After the sale was consummated, its syndicated unit was renamed to Capital Cities Television Productions (aka Capital Cities TV Productions and Capital Cities Productions). The new company took the name Capital Cities Television Corporation in November 1957, as both WROW/WCDA (now WTEN) and WTVD served the capital regions of their respective states. In 1992, Capital Cities/ABC sold Word Inc.'s music and book publishing to Thomas Nelson. The Capital Cities era\nIn 1956, WROW-TV moved from channel 41 to channel 10 and became WCDA.

For his record-breaking season performances, Young was awarded his second AP NFL MVP award, becoming the seventh player in NFL history to win both league and Super Bowl MVP honors in the same season. On the strength of a six-touchdown performance that surpassed the previous Super Bowl record of five, owned by the man Young replaced, Joe Montana, Young was named the MVP of Super Bowl XXIX, as the 49ers defeated the San Diego Chargers, 49–26. Young was named the AP's NFL Most Valuable Player in 1992 and 1994, and was the MVP of Super Bowl XXIX where he led the 49ers to a victory over the San Diego Chargers with a record six touchdown passes. While Montana won the NFL MVP award and led the team to a victory in Super Bowl XXIV, Young still had a good season, completing 69% of his passes for 1,001 yards, eight touchdowns, and only three interceptions. As a result, he went to his first Super Bowl as a starting quarterback. The 49ers were heavy favorites to become the first team with five Super Bowl victories. In 2007, Young co-founded Huntsman Gay Global Capital (HGGC) with billionaire industrialist Jon M. Huntsman and former Bain Capital executive Robert C. Gay. However, the 49ers lost the NFC Championship game, 30–20, to the eventual Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys.

For three months, Edmund would query on Joan's age of majority until he finally yielded. During the Second Barons' War, Robert was seen as an unreliable and violent ally to the barons, as he failed to appear promptly at the Battle of Lewes. Edward arrived at Tunis on 10 November 1270, but it was too late to engage in battle due to the Treaty of Tunis, which had been signed on 30 October. On 23 April 1291, due to Edmund's experience in managing his French domains, Edward granted Ponthieu to Edmund, which he was to administer until Edward's son Edward of Caernarfon gained the age of majority. Edmund's remains were embalmed and initially kept at the church of the Friars Minors in Bayonne. With his second wife Blanche, Edmund governed Champagne as count palatine in the name of his stepdaughter Joan until she came of age. Ceding Champagne and managing England\nAs Joan approached the age of 11, the age of majority in France, Edmund debated with his cousin King Philip III of France about whether Joan would still be under his guardianship until she turned 21, in accordance with the laws of Champagne. Edmund spent most of his childhood at Windsor Castle alongside his siblings. In the name of Joan, Edmund became the count palatine of Champagne and would govern the County along with his wife until Joan reached the age of majority. The Prince of Wales Llywelyn ap Gruffudd retreated southwards when Edward's army pressed hard in North Wales, but a detachment of Edmund's army lured Llywelyn into a trap and killed him in the Battle of Orewin Bridge on 11 December 1282. Commander at Wales and diplomat\nFollowing the deterioration of relations between England and the Welsh Kingdom of Gwynedd, Edmund's brother King Edward I of England declared war in November 1276. Subsequently, at some point between 1258 and 1263—either under Alexander or Pope Urban IV—the papacy revoked the grant of the Kingdom of Sicily to Edmund and instead bestowed the title upon Edmund's uncle, Charles I of Anjou. During the assembly at Norham on 13 June 1291 to select the next King of Scotland, Edmund witnessed the submission of rival claims to the Scottish crown under Edward's arbitration. Edmund also played a role in establishing a Greyfriars priory at Preston, located in his earldom of Lancaster. Deterioration of relations between the barons and the king resulted in the Second Barons' War, in which the royal government, supported by Edmund, triumphed over the baronage following the death of Montfort in the Battle of Evesham in 1265. When Joan reached the age of majority on 14 January 1284, Philip III compromised with Edmund's wife Blanche of Artois on 17 May via a treaty, allowing her to keep several of her dowerlands—the castles of Sézanne, Chantemerle, Nogent-sur-Seine, Pont-sur-Seine and Vertus, and the Palace of Navarrese Kings in Paris—and paying 60 to 70 thousand livres tournois to Edmund and Blanche. Hearing that his brother-in-law Robert II, Count of Artois, was in command of a French army at Langon, Edmund and his army left Bordeaux to meet him. Edmund and the nobles assembled their forces at Lyon in May 1282 to invade Provence, but the eruption of the Sicilian Vespers forced Charles to rent out Provence to Margaret, averting war. Even upon becoming king, Edward was not worried about Edmund's powerful position or the affairs of most of the baronage because of Edmund's unwavering loyalty to him. Payne had previously had success in the valley of the River Towy, capturing the castles of Dryslywn, Dinefwr, Carreg Cennan and Llandovery, allowing Edmund, who assumed his command, to push further north, seizing the lands of the Welsh noble Rhys ab Maelgwyn and taking Aberystwyth at the end of July 1277. In Paris, Edmund was unsuccessful in negotiating a compromise with Philip, until Philip's wife and Edmund's stepdaughter through Blanche, Queen Joan I of Navarre, and his cousin-in-law Queen Dowager of France Marie of Brabant offered to intervene on Edmund's behalf. Second marriage to Blanche of Artois\nEdmund's father King Henry III of England died on 16 November 1272, and Edmund's elder brother Edward was proclaimed king. In 1394, John of Gaunt, the founder of the second House of Lancaster and the husband of Edmund's great-granddaughter Blanche of Lancaster, interpreted the epithet differently, believing that Edmund was a hunchback. In the same year, Edmund's wife Blanche gave birth to their son Thomas, who became heir to the Earldom of Lancaster and all of Edmund's domains. The marriage between Edmund and Aveline was arranged by Edmund's mother, Eleanor of Provence. In 1298, she received a third of Edmund's estates as part of her dowry. Despite Simon's capture of Henry, Richard and Edward in the Baronial victory at Lewes on 14 May, he failed to consolidate his control over England and Edward mana"", 'From Edmund, Earl of Rutland:\nDeath\nEdmund died at the age of seventeen either during or shortly after the Battle of Wakefield (30 December 1460) during the Wars of the Roses. He was killed at the age of 17 either during or shortly after the Battle of Wakefield, during the Wars of the Roses. Thus fell, at the early age of seventeen, Edmund Plantagenet, Earl of Rutland, Lord Chancellor of Ireland. After the tide of battle turned against his father he attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge, but was overtaken and killed, possibly by the Lancastrian Lord Clifford, to avenge Clifford\'s father\'s death at the First Battle of St Albans. He had fought in the battle at the side of his father. Lord Chancellor of Ireland\nIn 1451, Edmund\'s father, who held the title of Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, appointed Edmund as Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Lord Clifford would himself be slain in March 1461 at the Battle of Ferrybridge. In popular culture\nIn Shakespeare\'s play, Henry VI, Part 3, Rutland is portrayed as a young boy who is brutally murdered by Clifford after pleading for his life; the source appears to be Edward Hall\'s 1548 Chronicle, which says, incorrectly, that Rutland is ""scarce of the age of twelve years"" at his death. He would continue serving as the de facto Chancellor until his death at the Battle of Northampton (10 July 1460). He was a younger brother of Edward, Earl of March, the future King Edward IV who came to the throne in 1461, the year after Edmund\'s death. However this story does not appear in any of the accounts of the battle written by the chroniclers of the time. Edmund and his father were buried at Pontefract Priory. His first Deputy Chancellor was Edmund Oldhall, Bishop of Meath. ""Edward\'s Younger Brother"" (PDF). His appointment and those of his Deputies were acknowledged by the Parliament of Ireland which at this time first asserted its independence. As Edmund was underage, the duties of the position were held by Deputy Chancellors. Edmund, Earl of Rutland (17 May 1443 – 30 December 1460) was the fourth child and second surviving son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York, and Cecily Neville. He was created Earl of Rutland by King Henry VI probably at some time before 1454, aged about 11, as Edmund and his elder brother Edward signed a letter to their father on 14 June 1454 as ""E. Rutland"" and ""E. Marche"". Edmund was possibly executed on the orders of the Lancastrian Lord Clifford, or by some accounts, by Lord Clifford himself. In Sharon Kay Penman\'s revisionist historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, Edmund is portrayed as a brave, sensitive and wise young man who mentors his youngest brother, Richard, and whose tragic death haunts his oldest brother, Edward, long after he becomes king. ""Save him"", implored the Chaplain; ""for he is the Prince\'s son, and peradventure may do you good hereafter."" The House of York in Ireland had won the support of Thomas FitzGerald, 7th Earl of Kildare, and James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond. The lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland, from the earliest times to the reign of Queen Victoria, London 1870 By the account given by Roderick O\'Flanagan in his 1870 biography of Edmund:\n\nUrged by his tutor, a priest named Robert Aspell, he was no sooner aware that the field was lost than he sought safety by flight. His head was displayed spiked upon the gates of York along with those of his father and of his uncle, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury. He was born in Rouen, then the capital of English-occupied France and his father held the office of Lieutenant of France. Oldhall was replaced by John Talbot, 2nd Earl of Shrewsbury, who also held the office of Lord High Steward of Ireland. On the other hand, the House of Lancaster found its main Irish supporter in the person of James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond. No record of the creation survives. The bodies were reburied, with great pomp, in the family vault at Fotheringhay Castle on 29–30 July 1476. Any officer attempting to enforce the rule of decrees from England would lose all of his property in Ireland and be subject to a fine. The Parliament declared that Ireland held separate legislature from the Kingdom of England and its subjects were only subject to the laws and statutes of ""the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons of Ireland, freely admitted and accepted in their Parliaments and Great Councils"". Several allies of the FitzGeralds followed them in their loyalties. This was an impolitic appeal, for it denoted hopes of the House of York being again in the ascendant, which the Lancastrians, flushed with recent victory, regarded as impossible. Struck with the richness of his armour and equipment, Lord Clifford demanded his name. His brother Sir William Oldhall was Chamberlain to the Duke of York and was likely behind that appointment. According to Parliamentary decisions during his term, the Irish subjects were only bound to answer writs by the Great Seal of Ireland, held by the Lord Chancellors.

Edmund Blackadder was at the battle of Carberry Hill in June 1567, and was one of the first to abandon the Queen and ride away. Although each series is set within a different period of British history, all the Edmund Blackadders in the franchise are part of the same familial line. Awards and decorations\nIn the series, Captain Blackadder is seen wearing the following ribbons:\n\nLord Edmund Blackadder / King Edmund III (Turn-of-the-Millennium)\nIn Blackadder: Back & Forth, Lord Edmund Blackadder is the modern representative of the Blackadder family. With the exception of the first Blackadder incarnation, Prince Edmund, each is generally cynical, charismatic and intelligent. (Regency Britain)\nEdmund Blackadder, Esq., is the Blackadder appearing in the Regency period of British history. At the 2000 Royal Variety Performance, Atkinson performed a short monologue called ""Blackadder: The Army Years"" as Captain Lord Edmund Blackadder of Her Majesty\'s Royal Regiment of Shirkers. He is notable for being one of the few members of the family not to be named Edmund, and also for his double-barrelled name, suggesting a family connection to Kevin Darling.

After the death of Richard IV and Edmund\'s older brother Harry (Robert East), he is briefly King of England; a lyric from one of the closing credits for Black Adder II describes him as ""a king / Although for only thirty seconds"". Sir Edmund Blackadder (English Civil War)\nSir Edmund Blackadder appears in the Comic Relief special Blackadder: The Cavalier Years; with the honorific of ""Sir"", this Blackadder is either a Baronet or a Knight. Prince Edmund is a very different character from his descendants: he is slow-witted, cowardly, and the butt of the other characters\' jokes.

Allen:\nThose facilities are still known today as the Edmund T. Allen Memorial Aeronautical Laboratories. Eddie Allen\'s contributions were recognized with some of aviation\'s greatest awards, including the very first Octave Chanute Award in 1939. Legacy\nOn 23 April 1946, three years after Eddie Allen\'s death in the crash of XB-29, he was posthumously awarded the Air Medal — an honor rarely bestowed upon a civilian — by direction of the President of the United States. Edmund Turney Allen (January 4, 1896 – February 18, 1943) was a pioneer of modern flight test who flew for nearly every major American aircraft manufacturer and took some of the most famous planes of all time up for their first flights. World War II\nIn April 1939, Boeing gave Allen a permanent position as the head of the company\'s Research Division, and direct charge of all flight testing and of aerodynamics and wind tunnel research. In 1919, he returned to the University of Illinois for a year and then studied aeronautical engineering for two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He then finished one year at the University of Illinois. B-29 Superfortress crash\nAs the United States became involved in World War II, Boeing was awarded a contract to build one of the most technologically advanced airplanes of the war, the B-29 Superfortress. Allen did not fit the image of the daredevil test pilot Hollywood promoted. He also piloted the first flight of the Curtiss-Wright CW-20 on 26 March 1940. He was posthumously awarded the Daniel Guggenheim Medal in 1943, the citation for which read: ""For major contributions to aeronautics leading to important advances in airplane design, flight research, and airline operation; particularly for the presentation of new methods for operational control and for the development of scientific and systematic methods in the flight testing of aircraft for basic design and performance data."" All of this helped lay the groundwork for the comprehensive flying qualities research that followed."" Theodore von Kármán intervened and recommended the Boeing wind tunnel be designed for airspeeds near the speed of sound. In the 1952 film Above and Beyond, it is mentioned that Allen was killed in a test flight of the B-29. Allen argued for such a wind tunnel and received authorization to build a tunnel, despite the cost estimate of $1 million. In 1940, Lockheed built a wind tunnel with the same test section size and speed capability as the University of Washington\'s wind tunnel. The aircraft crashed into the Frye Packing Plant just short of the runway; Allen, eight other crewmen, and 19 workers in the meat-processing factory were killed. He considered himself an engineer as well as a pilot, and insisted the test pilot should be involved in the development of new aircraft, not just fly them. Over the next five years he began to do more and more test flying, particularly for Boeing Airplane Company, an affiliate of the Boeing Air Transport which later became United Airlines. On 1 September 1927, when the Post Office got out of the flying business, Allen joined Boeing Air Transport, flying Boeing 40As as an airmail pilot on their new Chicago to San Francisco run. Below is a list of airplanes flown by Allen:\n\nBoeing Model 83, the forerunner of the famous Boeing F4Bs and Boeing P-12s (25 June 1928)\nNorthrop Alpha (March 1930)\nBoeing Monomail (22 May 1930)\nNorthrop Beta (3 March 1931)\nNorthrop Gamma (1932)\nStearman 80 (10 April 1933)\nDouglas DC-2 (11 May 1934)\nNorth American NA-16 (1 April 1935)\nSikorsky S-43 (5 June 1935)\nSpartan Executive (8 March 1937)\nSikorsky XPBS-1 (14 August 1937)\nBoeing XB-15 (15 October 1937)\nBoeing 314 Clipper (7 June 1938)\nBoeing 307 Stratoliner (31 December 1938)\nHe was also involved in the test flying of the Douglas DC-1 and the Consolidated XPB2Y-1. He also formed a dedicated flight-test and aeronautical research organization at Boeing and insisted that the company develop its own high-speed wind tunnel, an idea directly responsible for Boeing being in position to take the leadership in the development of large swept-wing jets. In 1929, Allen was one of several pilots, including Melvin N. Gough, William H. McAvoy, and Thomas Carroll, NACA trained ""in stability and control research techniques, including the ability to reach and hold equilibrium flight conditions with accuracy. In this position, he made the first flights of the:\n\nBoeing Stearman X-100 (XA-21; 25 January 1939)\nBoeing XPBB Sea Ranger (9 June 1942)\nBoeing B-17B (27 June 1939)\nBoeing B-17C (21 July 1940)\nBoeing B-17D (3 February 1941)\nBoeing B-17E (5 September 1941)\nBoeing B-17F (30 May 1942)\nBoeing XB-29 Superfortress (21 September 1942)\nEven his position at Boeing did not stop the Army Air Force from borrowing Allen for the first flight of the Lockheed C-69 Constellation on 9 January 1943.

They play at Kingston Park Stadium in the northern suburb of Kingston Park. Museums and galleries\nThere are several museums and galleries in Newcastle, including the Centre for Life with its Science Village; the Discovery Museum a museum highlighting life on Tyneside, including Tyneside\'s shipbuilding heritage, and inventions which changed the world; the Great North Museum; in 2009 the Newcastle on Tyne Museum of Antiquities merged with the Great North Museum (Hancock Museum); Seven Stories, the National Centre for Children\'s Books; the Side Gallery with historical and contemporary photography from around the world and Northern England; and the Newburn Motor Museum. Charles I was imprisoned in Newcastle by the Scots in 1646–7. The town had a new charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1589. Popular locations such as Ryton Island, Tyne Riverside Country Park, the city\'s golf courses, Newcastle Racecourse, and Newcastle International Airport fall inside the green belt. The church tower received a battering during the Siege of Newcastle by the Scots who finally breached the Town Wall and forced surrender. In 2018 Newcastle hosted the Great Exhibition of the North, the largest event in England in 2018. The Grainger Market architecture, like most in Grainger Town, which are either grade I or II listed, was listed grade I in 1954 by English Heritage. Fragments of Hadrian\'s Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. Significant Newcastle housing developments include Ralph Erskine\'s the Byker Wall designed in the 1960s, and now Grade II* listed. A former French consul in Newcastle called Jacques Serre assisted the German war effort by describing important targets in the region to Admiral Raeder who was the head of the German Navy. The city also has a Radio Lollipop station based at the Great North Children\'s Hospital in the Newcastle Royal Victoria Infirmary. The extent of Hadrian\'s Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. The Scots king William the Lion was imprisoned in Newcastle in 1174, and Edward I brought the Stone of Scone and William Wallace south through the town. Newcastle upon Tyne was one of the 11 host cities for the 2015 Rugby World Cup. The springtime dawn chorus at 55 degrees latitude has been described as one of the best in the world. In 1817 the Maling company, at one time the largest pottery company in the world, moved to the city. It was one of the world\'s largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was one of the first cities in the world to be lit up by electric lighting. The exhibition began on 22 June with an opening ceremony on the River Tyne, and ended on 9 September with the Great North Run weekend. Newcastle can have cool to cold winters, though usually warmer than the rural areas around it, and the winters are often compensated for by warm summers, with very long daylight hours in the summer months, longer than all other major English cities.

Game of the Year', 'From Historical thinking:\nPlacing historical events in chronological order is a way of identifying continuity and the ability to group events into identifiable periods helps to better understand their interconnection. First Order Sources or primary sources are contemporaneous records of events as they were first described or as they happened, without interpretive commentary (e.g., reports, speeches, letters). Their rubric divides history learning into three basic dimensions: major historical themes, chronological periods, and ways of knowing and thinking about history. Meanwhile, second order or secondary sources are those that corroborate, restate, explain, or interpret first order documents (e.g., commentaries, reviews, analyses). In both of these age ranges, the Center defines historical thinking in five parts:\n\nChronological Thinking\nHistorical Comprehension\nHistorical Analysis and Interpretation\nHistorical Research Capabilities\nHistorical Issues-Analysis and Decision-Making\nAs part of the national assessment effort called “The Nation’s Report Card, ” the United States Department of Education also developed benchmarks for student achievement in U.S. history. Finally third order or tertiary sources list or catalog other sources (e.g., encyclopedias). While second and third order sources are read for information, first order sources require students to draw inferences and make comparisons about the purposes, values, and world views of the authors to construct a narrative argument about history or assess what questions cannot be answered. History educators have varying perspectives about the extent they should emphasize facts about the past, moral lessons, connections to current events, or historical thinking skills and different belief about what historical thinking involves. Still, other critics believe that using textbooks undermines the process of learning history by sacrificing thinking skills for content—that textbooks allow teachers to cover vast amounts of names, dates, and places while encouraging students simply to memorize instead of question or analyze historical events. Although these benchmarks provide a model to develop historical literacies, Seixas states that these concepts can only can be applied with substantial learning about the past\n\nEstablishing Historical Significance is the ability to identify which events, issues, and trends are historically significant and how they connect to one another. When teaching with primary sources, it is important to understand the differences between First, Second, and Third order sources, which are ordered by the originality of material and their proximity to the source of origin. In response to the controversy over Texas textbooks, University of Northern Colorado History Department Chair, Fritz Fischer said that ""many of these problems could be solved if the school board prioritized making primary documents available to students, rather than deciding on which version of events ought to be taught."" Seixas and Peck note that this benchmark requires understanding causes and/or circumstances, that include ""...long-term ideologies, institutions, and conditions, and short-term motivations, actions and events"" that lead to particular consequences in history and affect the present. Benchmarks for Historical Thinking\nPeter Seixas, a professor at the University of British Columbia and creator of The Historical Thinking Project, outlines six distinct but closely interrelated historical thinking concepts that constitute historical thinking literacy in students. Sometimes called historical reasoning skills, historical thinking skills are frequently described in contrast to historical content knowledge such as names, dates, and places. The capstone stage in the SCIM-C model relies on students having analyzed a number of historical documents and having built some historical knowledge about the time, event, or issue being studied. The SCIM-C strategy focuses on the development of historical questions to be answered when analyzing primary sources. Historical thinking is a set of critical literacy skills for evaluating and analyzing primary source documents to construct a meaningful account of the past. The third dimension is further divided into two parts: historical knowledge and perspective, and historical analysis and interpretation. Teaching Models\nModels for historical thinking have been developed to better prepare educators in facilitating historical thinking literacies in students. Historical Thinking and Other Unnatural Acts. Teaching Historical Thinking in Grades 7-12."" Monitoring (Capstone Stage) involves identifying initial assumptions that may have been a part of the historical question asked. The distinction is generally made to underscore the importance of developing thinking skills that can be applied when individuals encounter any historical content. Taking a Historical Perspective is understanding different social, cultural, intellectual, and emotional perspectives that formed', 'From History:\nSome historians focus on the interpretative and explanatory aspects to distinguish histories from chronicles, arguing that chronicles only catalogue events in chronological order, whereas histories aim at a comprehensive understanding of their causes, contexts, and consequences. Primary sources offer the most direct evidence of historical events. This knowledge offers contexts for the interpretation of historical events. By period\nChronological division is a common approach to organizing the vast expanse of history into more manageable segments. History further examines the meaning of historical events and the underlying human motives driving them. History also plays a central role in so-called historical religions, which base some of their core doctrines on historical events. Another methodological tool is the examination of silences, gaps or omissions in the historical record of events that occurred but did not leave significant evidential traces. Traditional methodologies in history education often present numerous facts, like dates of significant events and names of historical figures, which students are expected to memorize. It is a creative aspect of historical writing that reconstructs, interprets, and explains what happened by showing how different events are connected. The period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory. For instance, Christianity is often categorized as a historical religion because it is centred around historical events surrounding Jesus Christ. This includes the examination of specific events, like the analysis of a particular battle and the discussion of the different causes of a war. ""History"" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. One view holds that there are general laws of history that determine the course of events, similar to the laws of nature studied in the natural sciences. A related topic concerns the nature of causal mechanisms connecting historic events with their causes and consequences.

The topics of philosophy of history and historiography overlap as both are interested in the standards of historical reasoning. Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of past events and societies. Related fields\nHistoriography\nHistoriography is the study of the methods and development of historical research. A philosophical topic regarding historical research is the possibility of an objective account of history. It is interested both in the past itself as a series of interconnected events and in the academic field studying this process. Archaeologists study man-made historical artefacts and other forms of material evidence. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. Instead, they highlight the subjective nature of historical interpretation, which leads to a multiplicity of divergent perspectives. Marxists interpret historical developments as expressions of economic forces and class struggles. The history of art, another connected discipline, examines historical works of art and the development of artistic activities, styles, and movements. They include narrative presentations of historical developments, questions to engage students and prompt critical thinking, and discussions on historical topics. The terms macrohistory, mesohistory, and microhistory refer to different scales of analysis, ranging from large-scale patterns that affect the whole globe to detailed studies of small communities, particular individuals, or specific events. These narratives cover not only how events unfolded but also why they happened and in which contexts, providing an explanation of relevant background conditions and causal mechanisms. Closely related to microhistory is the genre of historical biography, which recounts an individual\'s life in its historical context and the legacy it left. Historical research often starts with a research question to define the scope of the inquiry. History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyse pas', 'From List of boxing organisations:\nList of boxing organisations in chronological order by the year of their establishment.

The United States National Historic Landmark (NHL) program is operated under the auspices of the National Park Service, and recognizes buildings, structures, districts, objects, and similar resources nationwide according to a list of criteria of national significance. Background\nThe National Historic Landmark program is administered by the National Park Service, a branch of the U.S. Department of the Interior. National Historic Landmark Program at the National Park Service\nLists of National Historic Landmarks The primary difference between an NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have particular national significance, while other NRHP properties may be deemed significant at the local or state level. This is a complete List of National Historic Landmarks in Oregon. The NHLs in Oregon comprise 0.8% of the approximately 1,900 properties and districts listed on the NRHP in Oregon. National Park Service. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties, via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. The state of Oregon is home to 17 of these landmarks, two of which extend beyond Oregon\'s borders into other states, as well as one site from which NHL status was withdrawn upon its destruction. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as an NHL; when this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation. Both public and privately owned properties are designated as NHLs.

The National Historic Landmarks Program relies on suggestions for new designations from the National Park Service, which also assists in maintaining the landmarks. External links\n\nOfficial National Historic Landmarks Program website Approximately half of the National Historic Landmarks are privately owned. Current National Historic Landmarks\nMore than 2,500 NHLs have been designated. The origins of the first National Historic Landmark was a simple cedar post, placed by the Lewis and Clark Expedition on their 1804 outbound trek to the Pacific in commemoration of the death from natural causes of Sergeant Charles Floyd. A friends\' group of owners and managers, the National Historic Landmark Stewards Association, works to preserve, protect and promote National Historic Landmarks. Only some 2,500, or roughly three percent, of over 90,000 places listed on the country\'s National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) are recognized as National Historic Landmarks. The first National Historic Site designation was made for the Salem Maritime National Historic Site on March 17, 1938.In 1960, the National Park Service took on the administration of the survey data gathered under this legislation, and the National Historic Landmark program began to take more formal shape. Most of the designations made under this legislation became National Historic Sites, although the first designation, made December 20, 1935, was for a National Memorial, the Gateway Arch National Park (then known as the Jefferson National Expansion Memorial) in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1935, Congress passed the Historic Sites Act, which authorized the interior secretary authority to formally record and organize historic properties, and to designate properties as having ""national historical significance"", and gave the National Park Service authority to administer historically significant federally owned properties. All are designated as NHLs, but are not on the National Register. Correspondence between Charleston\'s mayor and the National Park Service provides additional perspective. A National Historic Landmark District may include many contributing properties that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may also include non-contributing properties. If not already listed on the National Register of Historic Places, an NHL is automatically added to the Register upon designation; about three percent of Register listings are NHLs. History\nPrior to 1935, efforts to preserve cultural heritage of national importance were made by piecemeal efforts of the United States Congress. A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is a building, district, object, site, or structure that is officially recognized by the United States government for its outstanding historical significance. Because listings (either on the National Register, or as an NHL) often triggered local preservation laws, legislation in 1980 amended the listing procedures to require owner agreement to the designations. There are NHLs in all 50 states and the national capital of Washington, D.C. Three states (Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, and New York) account for nearly 25 percent of the nation\'s NHLs. This collection of correspondence and documents associated with the NHL designation of Charleston Historic District, 347 pages, published by the National Archives and Records Administration, includes, in PDF pages 36–55, the October 9, 1960, press release issued by Secretary of the Interior Fred A. Seaton announcing designation of the first 92 NHLs in five major historic theme areas. Criteria\nNHLs are designated by the United States secretary of the interior because they are:\n\nSites where events of national historical significance occurred;\nPlaces where prominent persons lived or worked;\nIcons of ideals that shaped the nation;\nOutstanding examples of design or construction;\nPlaces characterizing a way of life; or\nArcheological sites able to yield information.

The apparel line began with wrestling shoes and has since expanded to clothing, posters and Adidas sponsored events. At the World Championships, Taylor had a tough start, as he faced his biggest threat of the tournament in the first round, \'16 Olympic Gold medalist and defending World champion Hassan Yazdani from Iran. At the World Cup, he defeated four top-level opponents: \'12 Olympic bronze medalist and two-time European Champion Dato Marsagishvili in the first round (8-3), that year\'s World Championship bronze medalist Vladislav Valiev (TF 14–4), \'12 Olympic Gold medalist Sharif Sharifov (TF 12–2), and \'16 Olympic Gold medalist Hassan Yazdani (fall). On the other side of the finale awaited rival and reigning Olympic and World Champion Hassan Yazdani from Iran, Taylor meeting him in a rubber match on August 5 after downing him twice earlier in his career. With his most prestigious accolades coming at 86 kilograms, Taylor was most notably the 2020 Summer Olympic gold medalist, a World champion in 2018, 2022 and 2023, and held one of the biggest rivalries in the sport\'s history against Hassan Yazdani. In the finale, Taylor faced reigning U23 World Champion and Penn State legend Bo Nickal, whom he is close with as a friend and teammate at the Nittany Lion Wrestling Club. He opened with a win over two-time (and defending) Pan American champion Yurieski Torreblanca, followed by Selim Yaşar on points and a fall over \'17 Junior World Champion Artur Naifonov to make the finals. In September, after dominantly cruising to the finals, Taylor avenged his loss to Hassan Yazdani and claimed his second World championship. He also clinched his third US National title, with four victories over fellow Americans. Then, after consecutive victories over Valencia, Taylor was back on the US World Team. ""We had a discussion leading up to it, and we have such a deep room in the wrestling club, especially at 86 kilos, so we\'re challenged every single day and none of us would be where we are without each other. He then warmed up at the Yasar Dogu of July, with four dominant pins over foreigners. In the finals, he got another fall, this time over Fatih Erdin, to claim the gold medal. At the World Championships, Taylor dominated once again, defeating everyone on his way either by fall or technical fall, including Hassan Yazdani, leading 5–1 in the series. On May, he claimed his first Pan American title, with notable wins over Yurieski Torreblanca, Pool Ambrocio and Eduardo Gajardo. He then claimed his first US Open National title in May, followed up by a technical fall over Cuba\'s Liván López at Beat the Streets. He came back to competition at the World Clubs Cup on December, where he helped the TMWC to second place with notable victories over Alireza Karimi and Pawan Kumar. In a battle of Tokyo Olympic champions, Taylor fell to seven–time World and Olympic champion Abdulrashid Sadulaev from Russia, in the first round. After the year was over, Taylor was named the UWW International Freestyle wrestler of the Year, and was awarded the John Smith Award winner as USA\'s Freestyle wrestler of the Year. After notorious wins on the first day over NCAA champion Michael Macchiavello and All-Americans Trent Hidlay and Marcus Coleman, Taylor made the best-of-three finals, where he faced returning World medalist Zahid Valencia. A fourth match with rival and reigning World Champion Hassan Yazdani took place in the finals, but this time the Iranian came up on top for the first time, nullifying Taylor and snapping his 57-match win streak, marking the series 3–1 in favor of Taylor and the latter leaving with a silver medal. In 2012, he competed at the US Olympic Team Trials, where he went 3–2. This result gained Taylor the 2020 Summer Olympic Games gold medal and extended his win-streak to 54 matches. Down 0–2 to a step-out and a passivity point in the second period, Taylor scored the first takedown to tie it up, though Yazdani scored another step-out to make it 2–3 on his favor, before being blasted by Taylor for two points late in the match, resulting in the stunning upset comeback win, shocking the world as the underdog going into the match. During April 2 to 3, Taylor competed at the rescheduled US Olympic Team Trials as the heavy favorite and top–seed. After almost a full year of no competition, Taylor came back to wrestle in March 2020, at the Pan American Olympic Qualification Tournament. Taylor was then scheduled to compete at the US Olympic Team Trials on April 4 at State College, Pennsylvania, where he was a heavy favorite.

As Taylor was attempting to escape back control, Grimaud trapped Taylor\'s arm and transitioned to an armbar, forcing Taylor to submit and thus retaining his welterweight title. Taylor\'s quarterfinal fight was against Dante Rivera, which Taylor also won, this time via unanimous decision. Taylor lost the match via unanimous decision. Taylor won the fight via unanimous decision. Griffin chose Taylor to take on Mike Dolce; In the second round, Taylor won the fight again via a rear naked choke. Taylor was picked sixth overall by Forrest Griffin. Kang later pulled out of the fight, and Jesse moved up to Light Heavyweight to fight Clay Davidson, defeating him in a unanimous decision. Personal life\nTaylor has two sons and a daughter. Taylor had now advanced to the semi-finals against his close friend Tim Credeur, a fight which Taylor won by unanimous decision, putting him into the finals. Early in the third round Grimaud took Taylor\'s back. Taylor was then rewarded with a scholarship to Cal State Fullerton. Taylor again won', 'From Don Callis:\nNotably, The Jackyl fought in his hometown, Winnipeg, as ""The General"", against Jim Neidhart in a losing effort. A former wrestler, Callis spent the majority of his career performing as either Cyrus (shortened from Cyrus the Virus) or Don Callis. In an effort to play up The Jackyl\'s gimmick as a charismatic, power-hungry fanatic, commentator Jim Ross often referred to him as the ""David Koresh of the World Wrestling Federation"". From 2001 to 2002, he appeared with Border City Wrestling, holding the BCW Can-Am Tag Team Championship with Terry Taylor. Donald Callis (born October 13, 1963) is a Canadian professional wrestling manager, color commentator, actor, and former professional wrestler and business executive. Championships and accomplishments\nAmateur Wrestling Association\nAWA Tag Team Championship (1 time) - with El Diablero\nBorder City Wrestling\nBCW Can-Am Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with Terry Taylor\nLutte Lanaudière\nLutte Lanaudière Tag Team Championship (1 time) – with El Diablero\nPro Wrestling Illustrated\nRanked No. Callis was there as a continued part of the storyline in which he had turned on Kenny Omega in favour of Takeshita. His character represented many of the real problems between ECW and TNN at that point, as he constantly criticized the violent nature of ECW programming. During the segment Jon Moxley struck Callis, who fell into a lighting rig and Callis\' head caught the edge of the Barn Door portion of the rig. Between 1991 and 1994, he held the championship a total of four times. On the July 3 episode of Dynamite, Ospreay left the Don Callis Family. Independent circuit (2001–2003, 2018)\nWith ECW out of business and WCW, which had expressed interest in signing Callis, purchased by the WWF, Callis returned to university, eventually earning a Master of Business Administration (MBA). On the May 29, 2024 episode of Dynamite, Trent Beretta joined the Don Callis Family. On the July 5 episode of AEW Rampage, Callis recruited Rush into the Don Callis Family. On the October 16 episode of Dynamite, Callis recruited Brian Cage into the Don Callis Family. An article in WWF Magazine claimed that he was a lower-level WWF employee during the early 1990s, and that he developed a messianic complex when he led a group of WWF wrestlers out of Kuwait when they were stranded there during the Gulf War. On the October 8 episode of Dynamite, Callis acquired Lance Archer from Jake Roberts in exchange for Rush. Callis claims he was released by Bruce Prichard for ""getting himself over at the expense of the talent"". On the June 17 episode of Impact!, Callis role as executive vice president was terminated by Tommy Dreamer. The group consisted of ""freakish"" wrestlers, including Golga (a masked Earthquake) and Kurrgan, among others. On September 20, 1997, Callis debuted in the WWF as ""The Jackyl"", a member (and eventually leader) of a group of wrestlers known as ""The Truth Commission"" (a take on the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission) replacing the Commandant for refusing to take bumps. When asked about his interference, he assured everyone that their questions would get answered on the December 8 episode of Impact!. On the November 6 episode of Dynamite, Hobbs had left the Don Callis Family after teaming with Ricochet against Fletcher and Takeshita. Callis then revealed he had been planning Omega\'s championship victory since both men first met in their native country of Canada decades ago. The Truth Commission stable was not particularly successful, with their biggest achievement being a victory over the Disciples of Apocalypse at Survivor Series 1997. On April 22, 2018, Callis served as the color commentator for the Redemption pay-per-view event as well as on the following episode of Impact!. Following this, Cyrus (kayfabe) canceled ECW on TNN (as the show was soon to be canceled legitimately, in favor of WWF Raw). Retirement (2004–2017)\nCallis departed from TNA on good terms in 2004, having been offered a job in International trade that made use of his MBA. As the real-life issues between ECW and their network TNN heightened, Callis was then presented as working for the network, under the shortened moniker of ""Cyrus"". During the Summer and Fall of 2018, Callis began appearing regularly alongside Josh Mathews on commentary for Impact events, eventually becoming the permanent color commentator for the promotion. The stable did not last long, and Callis eventually started managing the new tag team of Faarooq and Bradshaw, ""The Acolytes"", until he was released by the WWF. During this time, he claimed credit for the creation of the Ultimate X match, which he said he devised to settle a dispute over who the rightful X Division champion was. In storyline, Callis engaged in a power struggle with then Director of Authority Erik Watts and used his power to make life difficult for Jerry Lynn, repeatedly fining and suspending him. On January 28, 2004, Callis succeeded in ousting Watts from TNA when he defeat']",Graham High School in St. Paris Ohio,The provided context does not mention the high school or hometown of the 2020 Summer Olympic gold medalist who defeated Hassan Yazdani at the Japan Olympics in 2020.,0.3128325939178467,False,6,

There was controversy after the Beijing Olympic Games in 2008 when many Olympic swimmers broke records an unprecedented number of times using revolutionary swimsuits that covered their entire legs. In addition to these individual events, four swimmers can take part in either a freestyle or medley relay. Some short course competitions also include the 100-yard or 100-meter IM – particularly, for younger or newer swimmers (typically under 14 years) involved in club swimming, or masters swimming (over 18). Other pools which host events under World Aquatics regulations are required to meet some but not all of these requirements. In this latter event, swimmers swim equal distances of butterfly, then backstroke, breaststroke, and finally, freestyle. In the freestyle, swimmers originally dove from the pool walls, but diving blocks were incorporated at the 1936 Summer Olympics. Breaststrokers are now allowed to dip their heads completely under water to glide, which allows for a longer stroke and faster time. A medley relay consists of four swimmers who will each swim a different stroke, ordered as backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly and freestyle. In the past decade, American competitive swimmers have made the most use of the underwater dolphin kick, notably Olympic and World medal winners Michael Phelps and Ryan Lochte. Elite and international swimming\nElite and international swimming comprises the highest level of competition available to swimmers, including competitions such as the Olympic Games and the World Aquatics Championships. Olympic events are held in a 50-meter pool, called a long course pool. In 1902, the Australian Richmond Cavill introduced freestyle to the Western world. Popularity of the sport has grown in recent years, particularly since the 10 km open water event was added as an Olympic event in 2005, contested for the first time in the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. Men\'s swimming became part of the first modern Olympic Games in 1896 in Athens. In Olympic competition, this event is swum in two distances: 200 and 400 meters. To highlight the issue, in 2008, 70 world records were broken in one year, and 66 Olympic records were broken in one Olympic Games (there were races in Beijing where the first five finishers were swimming faster than the old world record). Technical-suited Amaury Leveaux set world records of 44.94 seconds in the 100 m freestyle, 20.48 seconds in the 50 m freestyle and 22.18 in the 50 m butterfly, spending more than half of each race submerged, more than any of his competitors. However, only the 10 km event is included in the Olympic schedule, again for both men and women. There are forty officially recognized individual swimming events in the pool; however the International Olympic Committee only recognizes 32 of them. Swimming is an event at the Summer Olympic Games, where male and female athletes compete in 16 of the recognized events each. Freestyle: 50 m, 100 m, 200 m, 400 m, 800 m, 1500 m\nBackstroke: 50 m, 100 m, 200 m\nBreaststroke: 50 m, 100 m, 200 m\nButterfly: 50 m, 100 m, 200 m\nIndividual medley: 100 m (short course only), 200 m, 400 m\nRelays: 4×50 m freestyle relay (short course only), 4×100 m freestyle, 4×200 m freestyle, 4×50 m medley relay (short course only), 4×100 m medley\nMixed relays (teams of two men and two women): 4×50 m mixed freestyle (short course only), 4×100 m mixed freestyle (long course only), 4×50 m mixed medley (short course only), 4×100 m mixed medley (long course only)\n\nHistorical breakthroughs\n— denotes instances that cannot be determined\n\nHealth benefits\nSwimming is a healthy activity that can be done by most people throughout their life. The 1904 Olympics\' freestyle race was the only one ever measured at 100 yards, instead of the usual 100 meters. In the American short course season, the 500-yard, 1000 yard, and 1650-yard freestyle events are swum as a yard is much shorter than a meter (100 yards equals 91.44 meters), while during the American long course season the 400 meter, 800 meter, and 1500-meter freestyle events are swum instead. A further removal of the 500 yd and 500 m freestyle, 150 m backstroke, and 3×100 m medley relay from the record listings occurred in 1952. The dolphin kick was rarely used in freestyle sprint races until 2008, when ""technical"" swimsuits were introduced to the sport at the European Short Course Championships in Rijeka, Croatia. By 1969 there were thirty-one events in which FINA recognised official world records – 16 for men, 15 for women – closely resembling the event schedule that was in use at the Olympic Games. They are:\n\nButterfly\nBackstroke\nBreaststroke\nFreestyle\nIn competition, only one of these styles may be used except in the case of the individual medley, or IM, which consists of all four. Records in events such as 300 yd, 300 m, 1000 yd, a', 'From Bill Smith (swimmer):\nAt the US Olympic trials of the 1948 4x200-meter freestyle relay, several swimmers who had already qualified in other events slowed down in their heats or swam fast in the prelims and scratched themselves for the final to allow more swimmers to qualify for the US Olympic Team.

At the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England, Smith won gold medals in the 400-meter freestyle and 4×200-meter freestyle relay. He also coached masters swimmers at the Kamehameha Swim Club. This quartet was used for the Olympic final and won the gold medal. At one time, Smith held all of the world records in freestyle swimming events between 200 and 1,000 meters. Ultimately, coach Robert Kiphuth did hold a time trial shortly after the actual trials with eleven of the swimmers. He was one of the most successful competitive swimmers in the United States in the first half of the 20th century. The next four-Eugene Rogers in 2:14.2, Edwin Gilbert in 2:15.4, Robert Gibe in 2:15.6, and William Dudley in 2:15.9, were used in the Olympic prelims. The next three swimmers-Joe Verdeur who came in 2:16.3, Alan Ford in 2;16.4 and George Hoogerhyde in 2:17.4 were not used in any capacity in the 4x200 freestyle relay. William Melvin Smith Jr. (May 16, 1924 – February 8, 2013) was an American former competition swimmer, two-time Olympic champion, and a former world record-holder in four events. After retiring from competitions Smith became captain of the surf guards at Waikiki Beach, coached swimmers at the University of Hawaii, and served as safety director for the Honolulu Department of Parks and Recreation for 25 years. Smith was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, of mixed Irish and Native Hawaiian ancestry. As a college swimmer, he was undefeated in three years of dual meet competition, and was a four-time All-American. He set seven world records and won fourteen U.S. national championships: seven NCAA, six AAU indoor and one AAU outdoor. Smith was one of the instigators of this ""conspiracy"". This time trial had Jimmy McLane as first overall with a time of 2:11.0, Bill Smith, and Wally Wolf in 2:11.2, and Wally Ris in 2:12.4. Smith was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1966. In 2001 he was named Ohio State University\'s swimmer of the century by the Columbus Touchdown Club. He died February 8, 2013; he was 88 years old.', 'From Summer McIntosh:\nHer older sister Brooke is a competitive pair skater. 2024 season\nAs with most of the Canadian team\'s top swimmers, McIntosh opted not to attend the 2024 World Aquatics Championships in Doha, citing its proximity to the 2024 Summer Olympics. She finished more than fourteen seconds ahead of second-place Ella Jansen. She won the silver medal, finishing 0.88 seconds behind Titmus but more than two seconds clear of Ledecky and the rest of the field. On the fourth day, she competed in the 200 metre individual medley, a much more uncommon event for her than the 400 metre individual medley. After coming third in the heats, she won the gold medal, finishing more than five seconds ahead of American silver medallist Katie Grimes to take her first Olympic title. The next, and final, stop of the World Cup circuit, McIntosh won the gold medal in the 200 metre butterfly on November 3, finishing in a personal best time of 2:03.40, which was the only time in the final faster than 2:04.00. Later in the day she joined the Canadian team in the final of the 4×200 metre freestyle relay. She then helped the Canadian team in the 4×200 metre freestyle relay, swimming the first leg as Canada won gold. Later in the same session she participated in the 4×100 m freestyle relay, earning a bronze medal with the Canadian team. Later in the same session McIntosh participated in the final of the 4×100 m freestyle relay, where the Canadian team finished fourth. In her first event, McIntosh finished fourth in the 400 metre freestyle, breaking the Canadian national record with a time of 4:02.42. At the inaugural edition of the Canadian Swimming Open in April, McIntosh won the 200 m freestyle with a world-leading time of 1:54.21. On the third and final day, she dropped 6.25 seconds from her personal best time in the 800 metre freestyle to win the silver medal with a Canadian record time of 8:07.12. Later the same session she joined the Canadian team in the final of the 4×100 metre freestyle relay; with Oleksiak absent and Ruck recovering from a hand injury, the team finished seventh. In the same session she joined the Canadian team in the final of the 4×200 m freestyle relay, where they finished fourth, a result she said she was ""pretty disappointed with."" McIntosh first drew recognition when, at age 14, she was the youngest member of the Canadian team for the 2020 Summer Olympics, where she achieved a fourth-place finish in the 400 metre freestyle. On the final day of the swimming competitions, McIntosh won two more silver medals, finishing behind Ariarne Titmus in the 400 metre freestyle while lowering her own national record and then swimming the freestyle leg of the 4 × 100 metre medley relay, typically performed for the Canadian team by the absent Oleksiak. In March and April 2023, in the span of five days, she set her first and second world records, in the 400 metre freestyle and 400 individual medley events, at the Canadian national trials. McIntosh was a finalist in voting for the Northern Star Award, given to the Canadian athlete of the year, and received the Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as the Canadian Press\' choice for Canadian female athlete of the year. The Canadian team won the bronze medal. 2021 season\nAs part of the 2021 Canadian Olympic swimming trials in Toronto, McIntosh won the 200 metre freestyle event over training partner Penny Oleksiak, with a personal best time of 1:56.19, which also marked the fastest time ever by a 14-year-old swimmer worldwide. McIntosh became the first Canadian woman to win two individual gold medals at a Summer Olympics, the first Canadian to win two gold medals at a Summer Olympics since sprinter Donovan Bailey in 1996, and the first Canadian swimmer to win three individual medals at a single Olympics.

On April 14, 1960, Motown and Tamla Records merged into a new company called Motown Record Corporation. Motown Records joined Interscope Capitol Labels Group in 2024.

Seagram had purchased Motown\'s former parent MCA in 1995, and Motown was in effect reunited with many of its MCA corporate siblings (Seagram had hoped to build a media empire around Universal, and started by purchasing PolyGram).

Never Broke Again: A record label founded by YoungBoy Never Broke Again. Several of Gordy\'s family members, including his father Berry Sr., brothers Robert and George, and sister Esther, were given key roles in the company. Motown Records: Established 1960, Motown was and remains the company\'s main label for mainstream R&B/soul music (and, today, hip-hop music as well). The label\'s numbering system was combined with those of Tamla and Gordy in 1982, and the label (and company) was purchased by MCA in 1988.

In 1958, Gordy recorded the group\'s song ""Got a Job"" (an answer song to ""Get a Job"" by the Silhouettes), and released it as a single by leasing the record to a larger company outside Detroit called End Records, based in New York. Pop singer Charlene\'s #3 pop single for Motown I\'ve Never Been To Me was originally released and charted on this label in 1977 (#97).

Los Angeles: 1972–1998\nAfter the songwriting trio Holland–Dozier–Holland left the label in 1967 over royalty-payment disputes, ', ""From Geffen Records:\nOriginally a music subsidiary of the company known as Geffen Pictures, it is owned by the Interscope Geffen A&M (IGA) faction of Universal Music Group (UMG). In the ensuing months, a number of corporate reshufflings occurred, resulting in Geffen and A&M, on New Year's Eve 1998, being merged into Interscope Geffen A&M Records. Unlike A&M, which was closed entirely, Geffen was able to continue existing as a one-off brand under Interscope Records. That same year, after disputes with Interscope co-founder Jimmy Iovine (at the time, the chairman and CEO of Interscope Geffen A&M, parent unit of Geffen), former labelmates 50 Cent and Dr. Dre, rapper The Game was dismissed from G-Unit Records and Interscope division imprint Aftermath Entertainment (the respective labels of the aforementioned latter two), but was later transferred to Geffen to avoid contractual obligations with G-Unit. On December 9, 1996, Geffen's parent company, MCA Inc. was reincorporated as Universal Studios, Inc. Relaunches (2011–2017)\nInterscope Geffen A&M chairman and CEO Jimmy Iovine relaunched Geffen in 2011, moving its headquarters from Santa Monica to New York City. At the same time, international distribution of Interscope and Geffen releases respectively switched from BMG Distribution and Island Records UK to ex-PolyGram label Polydor Records, which had already been distributing A&M releases overseas (in return for A&M handling Polydor releases in the U.S.); A&M was forced to remain as a one-off active label for Interscope following a lawsuit by its co-founders Jerry Moss and Herb Alpert, which was later settled in 2003. PolyGram merger and Interscope Geffen A&M (1999–2003)\nOn December 10, 1998, Seagram completed its seven-month $10.6 billion plan to acquire PolyGram. Geffen's urban division pertained even more notoriety with the IGA resigning of Keyshia Cole through the imprint, following DGC's relaunch and A&M's revitalization as A&M Octone Records in 2007; Cole was previously signed to sister label A&M early in her career from 2004 to that point. On May 28, 2014, Iovine departed from Interscope Geffen A&M as its chairman and CEO and hired Fueled by Ramen co-founder John Janick as his replacement. Interscope Geffen A&M became one of Universal Music Group's four new label factions alongside the Verve Label Group, Universal Motown Republic Group and the Island Def Jam Music Group. Geffen now became sister labels to A&M Records, Island Records, Mercury Records, Def Jam Recordings and Motown (which had previously been a part of UMG during its preceding MCA days from 1988 to 1993). Warner Bros. Records provided 100 percent of the funding for the label's start-up and operations, while it distributed its releases in North America, with CBS's Epic Records handling distribution in the rest of the world until 1985 when Warner Music Group (parent company of Warner Records and formerly a division of Time Warner/Warner Bros. Geffen Records would distribute releases on the newly-founded company's DreamWorks Records subsidiary. At the same time, it is projected to reissue many releases from recording labels (some of which have been directly absorbed into Geffen) such as Decca Records (exclusively the American pop/rock catalog), Kapp Records, DreamWorks Records, MCA Records, Uni Records, Chess Records, Almo Sounds (Interscope has managed reissues of the label in 2015), Dot Records, ABC Records (primarily its pop, rock, and R&B recordings) and DGC Records (the label had merged into Geffen in 2021 with reissues now being handled by the parent label). Continued success (2003–2009)\nAs the mid-2000s progressed, Geffen's absorption of the MCA, DGC and DreamWorks labels, along with the signage of new acts such as Ashlee Simpson, Angels & Airwaves and Snoop Dogg, had boosted the company to the extent that it began gaining equal footing with the main Interscope label, leading some industry insiders to speculate that it could revert to operating as an independently managed imprint at UMG again. This prompted Geffen to create a subsidiary label, DGC Records (formerly the David Geffen Company), in 1990; which focused on more progressive rock and would later embrace the emergence of alternative rock—Nirvana being an example. Acquisitions by MCA, Panasonic, and Seagram and departure of David Geffen (1990–1998)\nAfter nearly a decade of operating through WMG, its contract with the company ended. Subsequently, the album went on to sell millions and gave Geffen its first number-one album and single; the rights to the album would later be taken over by EMI, which eventually would be absorbed by Geffen's then-future parent, Universal Music Group in 2012. In December 2019, Neil Jacobson vacated his position as the president of Geffen, leaving to start his own company, Crescent Drive Productions. Since 2024, Geffen has been a part of Universal Music Group's Interscope Capitol Labels Group. However, in late 2013, the label went idle with a majority of Geffen's artists now "", ""From Interscope Geffen A&M Records:\nEnraged, A&M co-founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss filed suit against Universal and parent company Seagram in June for breach of contract, citing a breach of the company's integrity clause following the merger of A&M into IGA and later dormancy. It helped parent company Universal Music Group see a 12.6% increase in a $7.1 billion with 31% streaming spikes. With Geffen now existing as the only active label under the IGA shade, over 280 jobs were eliminated (including 110 from Geffen) and A&M's former Charlie Chaplin studio/Jim Henson company lot offices were closed. 1999: A&M and DGC Records folding, lawsuit and staff layoffs\nAs a result of the merger, on January 22, three weeks after the PolyGram-UMG merger, both A&M Records and Geffen division DGC Records went dormant with a certainty of artists drafted to either Geffen or Interscope, while a significant percentage of artists and/or bands were dropped from A&M and Geffen. The combined labels were altogether consolidated into an umbrella unit known publicly as Interscope Geffen A&M Records. By 2001, Interscope Geffen A&M began to recover commercially, despite the February departure of Ted Field. Interscope Geffen A&M Records (IGA) is an American umbrella label operating as a unit of Interscope Capitol Labels Group, owned by Universal Music Group. It currently consists of record labels Interscope Records (with its subsidiary, A&M Records) and Geffen Records. The success of the album garnered 50 Cent his own label, G-Unit Records, in a distribution deal with Interscope Geffen A&M Records, rather than a division deal. In November 2024, A&M Records is revived by IGA as a new subsidiary of Interscope. As a result, A&M Octone Records was absorbed into Interscope Records, with the entirety of its roster being deferred, finally ending the A&M label name completely while following suit with DGC. However, the early stages of 2005 proved to be difficult for Interscope Geffen A&M as a violent feud between its breakout rappers 50 Cent and The Game reached a heavy peak following a radio station shooting. DGC Records was revived as a direct subsidiary of the unit while A&M Records was revitalized as A&M Octone Records. In 2006, producer Timbaland joined Interscope Geffen A&M in a label division deal through his imprint, Mosley Music Group, while helping the unit resign Nelly Furtado under his wing. 2004–07: Label distribution deals, A&M re-emergence, G-Unit problems and Octone Records\nIn 2004, Star Trak Entertainment, a label run by production duo The Neptunes (Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo), ended their partnership with Arista Records, shortly after the firing of its president, music executive L.A. Reid, which preceded the label's merger with RCA Records in reference to UMG's rival music company; RCA and Arista's parent Bertelsmann Music Group's merger with Sony Music that year. On time for New Year's Day 1999, Universal Music combined the operations of MCA sister labels Interscope Records and Geffen Records with PolyGram subsidiary A&M Records. This was during this period that a company reorganization concerning parent Universal Music Group was happening, of which not only Iovine departed from IGA, but its sister unit, the Island Def Jam Music Group was dismantled with Island, Def Jam and affiliated labels being autonomously solidified on their own. 50 Cent left Interscope Geffen A&M, taking his G-Unit imprint with him to sign with UMG sister label Capitol Records through its independent Caroline Records faction (now Virgin Music). Interscope Geffen A&M became the number-one music unit of the year, according to Billboard's year end report with over 68 of its albums charted on the Billboard 200 throughout the year. With DGC, Beck, Weezer and Sonic Youth were brought back into the fold, while many of A&M's artists were moved to either Geffen or Interscope including the Black Eyed Peas. 2014–20: Commercial re-emergence and Geffen relaunch\nInterscope Geffen A&M began to see more dominance with Lana Del Rey, whose sophomore studio album, Ultraviolence, managed to debut at number one on the Billboard 200 upon release that July. 2000–03: Recovery and dominance\nAs independent labels, A&M and Geffen were revered, having had achieved substantial commercial and artistic success. The feud between 50 Cent and the Game caused the latter to cut ties with G-Unit and Dr. Dre's Aftermath imprint, while later being transferred from Interscope to Geffen to remain under the Interscope Geffen A&M umbrella, being able to help Game avoid contractual obligations with G-Unit. A&M Octone was seen as a joint venture between the co-owners of Octone and IGA. In 2019, Interscope Geffen A&M sustained another successful milestone with Billie Eilish becoming the first Generation Z and 21st century-born musical artist to have a number one debut album and single in the same period with When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?

Currency\nMartin Van Buren appeared in the Presidential dollar coins series in 2008. Along with being the first U.S. president who was not born a British subject, Van Buren was also the first U.S. president not of British ancestry; he was of entirely Dutch descent. She had three children from her first marriage, including future U.S. Representative James I. Nationwide, Van Buren won 10.1% of the popular vote, the strongest showing by a third-party presidential nominee up to that point in U.S. history. The U.S. Mint also issued commemorative silver medals for Van Buren, released for sale in 2021. Van Buren also worked on a history of American political parties and embarked on a tour of Europe, becoming the first former U.S. president to visit Britain. Van Buren blamed the economic collapse on greedy American and foreign business and financial institutions, as well as the over-extension of credit by U.S. banks. Van Buren had hoped he would not have to take a public stand on annexation, but as the Texas question came to dominate U.S. politics, he decided to make his views on the issue public. Amistad case: victory for the ex-slaves\nThe Amistad case was a freedom suit that involved international issues and was decided by the U.S. Supreme Court. The president countered by proposing the establishment of an independent U.S. treasury, which he contended would take the politics out of the nation\'s money supply. At the same time, Van Buren opposed the Adams-Clay plans for internal improvements like roads and canals and declined to support U.S. participation in the Congress of Panama. The Panic of 1837 loomed large over the 1838 election cycle, as the carryover effects of the economic downturn led to Whig gains in both the U.S. House and Senate. Scott impressed upon American citizens the need for a peaceful resolution to the crisis, and made it clear that the U.S. government would not support adventuresome Americans attacking the British. Items on which he did not achieve success included settling the Maine-New Brunswick boundary dispute with Great Britain, gaining settlement of the U.S. claim to the Oregon Country, concluding a commercial treaty with Russia, and persuading Mexico to sell Texas. Several writers have portrayed Van Buren as among the nation\'s most obscure presidents. While Van Buren is praised for anti-slavery stances, in historical rankings, historians and political scientists often rank Van Buren as an average or below-average U.S. president, due to his handling of the Panic of 1837. Van Buren\'s presidency had been a difficult affair, with the U.S. economy mired in a severe downturn, and other divisive issues, such as slavery, western expansion, and tensions with the United Kingdom, providing opportunities for Van Buren\'s political opponents—including some of his fellow Democrats—to criticize his actions. A primary founder of the Democratic Party, he served as New York\'s attorney general and U.S. senator, then briefly as the ninth governor of New York before joining Andrew Jackson\'s administration as the tenth United States secretary of state, minister to Great Britain, and ultimately the eighth vice president from 1833 to 1837, after being elected on Jackson\'s ticket in 1832. In April 1861, former president Pierce wrote to the other living former presidents and asked them to consider meeting to use their stature and influence to propose a negotiated end to the war. As noted in a 2014 Time magazine article on the ""Top 10 Forgettable Presidents"":\n\nMaking himself nearly disappear completely from the history books was probably not the trick the ""Little Magician"" Martin Van Buren had in mind, but his was the first truly forgettable American presidency.

Tompkins. Van Buren supported Franklin Pierce for president in 1852, James Buchanan in 1856, and Stephen A. Douglas in 1860. Worried about sectional tensions, Van Buren returned to the Democratic Party after 1848 but was disappointed with the pro-southern presidencies of Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan. Van Buren won 146 of the 266 votes on the first presidential ballot, with only 12 of his votes coming f', 'From Franklin D.

Roosevelt at the Internet Archive After Roosevelt took office, he withdrew U.S. forces from Haiti and reached new treaties with Cuba and Panama, ending their status as U.S. protectorates. First and second terms (1933–1941)\nWhen Roosevelt was inaugurated on March 4, 1933, the U.S. was at the nadir of the worst depression in its history. In September, a German submarine fired on the U.S. destroyer Greer, and Roosevelt declared that the U.S. Navy would assume an escort role for Allied convoys in the Atlantic as far east as Britain and would fire upon German ships or U-boats of the Kriegsmarine if they entered the U.S. Navy zone. The following year, Roosevelt\'s fifth cousin Theodore Roosevelt became U.S. president. Roosevelt firmly established U.S. leadership on the world stage with his role in shaping and financing World War II. Relying on an interventionist political coalition of Southern Democrats and business-oriented Republicans, Roosevelt oversaw the expansion of U.S. airpower and war production capacity. He did not loosen immigration quotas but did allow German Jews already in the U.S. on visas to stay indefinitely. Roosevelt made it clear that, in the event of German aggression against Czechoslovakia, the U.S. would remain neutral. Thus, Roosevelt had committed the U.S. to the Allied side with a policy of ""all aid short of war"". After Nazi Germany and Italy declared war on the U.S. on December 11, 1941, the United States Congress approved additional declarations of war in return. This ""shoot on sight"" policy brought the U.S. Navy into direct conflict with German submarines and was favored by Americans by a margin of 2-to-1. War plans\nIn late December 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met at the Arcadia Conference, which established a joint strategy between the U.S. and Britain. Roosevelt personally supported U.S. membership in the League, but, unlike Wilson, he favored compromising with Senator Henry Cabot Lodge and other ""Reservationists"". Though Churchill pressed for an American declaration of war against Germany, Roosevelt believed that Congress would reject any attempt to bring the U.S. into the war. In 1943, Roosevelt told U.S. government officials that there should be limits on Jews in various professions to ""eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the Germans bore towards the Jews in Germany."" Legacy\nHistorical reputation\nRoosevelt is widely considered to be one of the most important figures in U.S. history, and one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. He also placed the Philippine military under American command and reinstated General Douglas MacArthur into active duty to command U.S. forces in the Philippines. The Japanese advance reached its maximum extent by June 1942, when the U.S. Navy scored a decisive victory at the Battle of Midway. In April 1917, after Germany declared it would engage in unrestricted submarine warfare and attacked several U.S. ships, Congress approved Wilson\'s call for a declaration of war on Germany. Foreign policy (1933–1941)\nThe main foreign policy initiative of Roosevelt\'s first term was the Good Neighbor Policy, which was a re-evaluation of U.S. policy toward Latin America. The U.S. and Britain established the Combined Chiefs of Staff to coordinate military policy and the Combined Munitions Assignments Board to coordinate the allocation of supplies. Nonetheless, historical rankings consistently place him among the three greatest American presidents. A member of the prominent Delano and Roosevelt families, Roosevelt was elected to the New York State Senate from 1911 to 1913 and was then the assistant Secretary of the Navy under President Woodrow Wilson during World War I. Roosevelt was James M. Cox\'s running ', 'From United States presidential inauguration:\nThe walk has become a tradition that has been matched in ceremony if not in length by the presidents who followed. By convention, incoming presidents raise their right hand and place the left on a Bible or other book while taking the oath of office. As an art lover and admirer of the ancient Greek high-relief coins, Roosevelt wanted more than a simple medal—he wanted a work of art. Notes\nGraphical timeline of U.S. presidents\nSee also\nUnited States presidential transition\n\nReferences\nFurther reading\nInaugural Addresses of the Presidents of the United States. While many of the early presidents read their addresses before taking the oath, current custom dictates that the chief justice administer the oath first, followed by the president\'s speech. Inaugural address\nNewly sworn-in presidents usually give a speech referred to as an inaugural address. In 1877, due to the controversy over the Compromise of 1877, Rutherford B. Hayes was sworn in secretly on March 3 before Ulysses S. Grant\'s term ended on March 4—raising the question if the United States had two presidents at the same time for one day. Improvements in mass media technologies have allowed presidents to reach substantially greater numbers of their constituents. Most presidents use their inaugural address to present their vision of America and to set forth their goals for the nation. The luncheon is held in Statuary Hall and is organized by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, and attended by the leadership of both houses of Congress as well as guests of the president and vice president. Since 1933 an associated prayer service either public or private attended by the president-elect has often taken place on the morning of the day. This numerical discrepancy results chiefly from two factors: a president must take the oath at the beginning of each term of office, and, because the day of inauguration has sometimes fallen on a Sunday, five presidents have taken the oath privately before the public inaugural ceremonies. In 1977, Jimmy Carter became the first president to set out by foot for more than a mile on the route to the White House. This is not the same as the Inaugural Prayer, a tradition also begun by Washington, when on June 1, 1789, Methodist bishops Francis Asbury and Thomas Coke, Rev. Others, in addition to the chief justice, have administered the oath of office to several of the nine vice presidents who have succeeded to the presidency upon their predecessor\'s death or resignation intra-term. Saint-Gaudens\' design, executed by Adolph A. Weinman, was cast by Tiffany & Company and was proclaimed an artistic triumph. Inauguration Day, while not a federal holiday, is observed as a holiday by federal employees who would be working in the ""Inauguration Day Area"" and who are regularly scheduled to perform non-overtime work on Inauguration Day. Attendees\nIn addition to the public, the attendees at the inauguration generally include the vice president, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, high-ranking military officers, former presidents and vice-presidents, living Medal of Honor recipients, and other dignitaries.

Mott, the Silver Party National Chairman, went to great lengths to organize state parties, but his efforts did not produce dramatic results. Incumbent Democratic President Grover Cleveland did not seek election to a second consecutive term (which would have been his third overall), leaving the Democratic nomination open. History of American Presidential Elections. The Presidential Election of 1896. They decided to wait until after the conventions of the two major parties in case one of them agreed to the 16:1 coinage demands. The content of his speeches revolved around progressive policies such as the free coinage of silver and progressive tax reform that appealed to lower-class Americans. ""William Jennings Bryan and the Presidential Campaign of 1896"". Presidential elections were held in the United States on November 3, 1896. ""Republican Strategy and the Farm Vote in the Presidential Campaign of 1896"". At their national convention in 1896, the Populists chose Bryan as their presidential nominee. The 1896 Democratic National Convention repudiated the Cleveland administration and nominated Bryan on the fifth presidential ballot. ""Building Populist Discourse: An Analysis of Populist Communication in American Presidential Elections, 1896–2016."" ""Goldbugs, Silverites, and Satirists: Caricature and Humor in the Presidential Election of 1896"". McKinley became the first Republican to ever carry Kentucky in a presidential election, and Bryan the first Democrat to ever carry Nebraska and Kansas (as well as several other western states that had only recently been admitted to the union) in a presidential election. Near the beginning of that year, U.S. senators from silver-producing states (Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and Montana) began objecting to President Benjamin Harrison\'s economic policies and advocated the free coinage of silver. The Palmer-Buckner ticket remains the only third-party presidential campaign in history to have earned the endorsement of the New York Times. The delegates approved the minority report that had been rejected at the Prohibitionist Convention calling for free coinage and greenbacks, government control of railroads and telegraphs, direct election of senators and the president, and an income tax among others. The novelty of seeing a visiting presidential candidate, combined with Bryan\'s spellbinding oratory and the passion of his believers, generated huge crowds. This was the first time a Republican presidential candidate had ever carried Kentucky, but they did not do so again until Calvin Coolidge in 1924. He was the first presidential candidate since Stephen Douglas in 1860 to canvass directly, and the first ever to criss-cross the nation and meet voters in person. As of 2024, this is the last occasion Northampton County has voted for a Republican presidential candidate, which stands as the longest Democratic streak in the nation. After a majority of 188 brought the report forward, ""Narrow-Gaugers"" campaigned among wavering delegates of the Northeast and Midwest to convince them of the electoral consequences should it be adopted: that Party gains in states like New York would reverse overnight in the face of free coinage and populism. The ""Broad-Gauge"" wing, led by Charles Bentley and former Kansas Governor John St. John, demanded the inclusion of planks endorsing the free coinage of silver at 16:1 and of women\'s suffrage, the former refusing to accept the nomination if such amendments to the party platform were not approved. A minority report by St. John supported the free coinage of silver, government control of railroads and telegraphs, an income tax and referendums, and was prevented from being tabled, giving ""Broad-Gaugers"" confidence, but a number of those who voted for the report were merely undecided or against gagging the report. The 1896 presidential election is often seen as a realigning election, in which McKinley\'s view of a stronger central government building American industry through protective tariffs and a dollar based on gold triumphed. Torn between choosing their own presidential candidate or supporting Bryan, the party leadership decided that nominating their own candidate would simply divide the forces of reform and hand the election to the more conservative Republicans. Influence of the 1896 campaigns\nCampaign strategies of both sides changed how candidates campaign in elections in the United States, shifting presidential campaigns to be more candidate-focused and reliant on campaign messaging to attract donors. In the presidential election of 1892, Populist candidate James B. Weaver carried four states, and in 1894, the Populists scored victories in congressional and state legislature races in a number of Southern and Western states. Harpine, William D.

A 1962 survey was also conducted by Schlesinger, who surveyed 75 historians. The study organizers noted a drop in recent Republican presidents\' scores by speculating that respondents put more weight towards a president\'s fealty towards political and institutional norms.

The questions were the same as in the USPC survey, which was directed by some of the same people. Franklin D. Roosevelt still ranked in the top three, but editor James Taranto noted that Democratic-leaning scholars rated George W. Bush the sixth-worst president of all time while Republican scholars rated him the sixth-best, giving him a split-decision rating of ""average"". 63% believed that the president should be elected by a national popular vote; whereas, 17% supported the Electoral College. His algorithm placed Franklin Roosevelt as the best president for the economy, followed by Harding, Hayes and McKinley tied for second.
