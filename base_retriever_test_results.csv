Simon created or co-created many important characters in the 1930s–1940s Golden Age of Comic Books and served as the first editor of Timely Comics, the company that would evolve into Marvel Comics.\nWith his partner, artist Jack Kirby, he co-created Captain America, one of comics\' most enduring superheroes, and the team worked extensively on such features at DC Comics as the 1940s Sandman and Sandy the Golden Boy, and co-created the Newsboy Legion, the Boy Commandos, and Manhunter. Simon and Kirby creations for other comics publishers include Boys\' Ranch, Fighting American and the Fly. In the late 1940s, the duo created the field of romance comics, and were among the earliest pioneers of horror comics. Simon, who went on to work in advertising and commercial art, also founded the satirical magazine Sick in 1960, remaining with it for over a decade. He briefly published with DC Comics in the 1970s.\nSimon was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nEarly life\nJoe Simon was born in 1913 as Hymie Simon and raised in Rochester, New York, the son of Harry Simon, who had emigrated from Leeds, England, in 1905, and Rose (Kurland), whom Harry met in the United States. Harry Simon moved to Rochester, then a clothing-manufacturing center where his younger brother Isaac lived, and the couple had a daughter, Beatrice, in 1912. A poor Jewish family, the Simons lived in ""a first-floor flat which doubled as my father\'s tailor shop"". Simon attended Benjamin Franklin High School, where he was art director for the school newspaper and the yearbook – earning his first professional fee as an artist when two universities each paid $10 publication rights for his art deco, tempera splash pages for the yearbook sections.\n\nCareer\nBeginnings\nUpon graduation in 1932, Simon was hired by Rochester Journal-American art director Adolph', 'From Joe Phillips:\nJoe Phillips is an American artist, known for his gay-themed illustration, erotic animation, and his earlier work on superhero comic books.\n\nEarly life\nPhillips was born in Atlanta, Georgia in 1969. He attended Northside School of the Arts, where he learned skills such as set design and designing costumes. Upon graduation he traveled to Europe where he took part in projects such as guerrilla street art.\n\nCareer\nComic books\nUpon his return to the United States, he worked on the comic book series Southern Knights. His first major comic book job was penciling eight issues of the comic book Speed Racer for NOW Comics, starting in 1988. In 1989 he took over penciling interiors and covers for DC Comics\' Mister Miracle with issue #7, continuing until the series ended in 1991. He then penciled two issues of Wonder Woman, filling in between retiring artist George Pérez and new regular artist Jill Thompson, and went on to produce art for DC and Marvel Comics titles including Justice League of America, Silver Surfer, X-Men, Legion of Super-Heroes, The Incredible Hulk, and Lobo.\nPhillips was one of the founding members of Gai-Jin Studios, a comic book studio whose past members include artists such as Adam Hughes and Brian Stelfreeze. In late 1992, Phillips penciled a story arc featuring the Legion of Super-Heroes character Timber Wolf, written and inked by Al Gordon. In 1996 he created a new comic book character, Heretic, published by Dark Horse Comics. Other later work included Captain America, Wolverine, Green Lantern, and Superboy. In 2008, Phillips worked on the Doctor Who comic book.\n\nLGBT-themed work\nIn his art for the Superboy comic Superboy & Risk: Double Shot, Phillips dropped ""easter eggs"" hinting at his homosexuality.

The city is on the Potomac River, across from Virginia, and shares land borders with Maryland to its north and east. It was named after George Washington, the first president of the United States. The district is named after Columbia, the female personification of the nation.\nThe U.S. Constitution in 1789 called for the creation of a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress. As such, Washington, D.C., is not part of any state, and is not one itself. The Residence Act, adopted on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of the capital district along the Potomac River. The city was founded in 1791, and the 6th Congress held the first session in the unfinished Capitol Building in 1800 after the capital moved from Philadelphia. In 1801, the District of Columbia, formerly part of Maryland and Virginia and including the existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria, was officially recognized as the federal district; initially, the city was a separate settlement within the larger district. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia, including the city of Alexandria. In 1871, it created a single municipality for the remaining portion of the district. There have been several unsuccessful efforts to make the district into a state since the 1880s; a statehood bill passed the House of Representatives in 2021 but was not adopted by the U.S. Senate. To become law it would have to be passed by the Senate and signed by president; it would have renamed the city Washington, Douglass Commonwealth and shrunk the Federal District to about the size of the national mall.\nDesigned in 1791 by Pierre Charles L'Enfant, the city is divided into quadrants, which are centered around the Capitol Building and include 131 neighborhoods. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 689,5"", 'From Keyser, West Virginia:\nKeyser () is a city in and the county seat of Mineral County, West Virginia. It is part of the Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 4,853 at the 2020 census.\n\nHistory\nKeyser, the county seat of Mineral County, is located on the North Branch of the Potomac River at its juncture with New Creek in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia. Throughout the centuries, the town went through a series of name changes, but was ultimately named after William Keyser, a Baltimore and Ohio Railroad official.\nThe first local land grant was issued by Lord Fairfax to Christopher Beelor on March 20, 1752. The place was first called Paddy Town, for Patrick McCarty, an Irish immigrant who came to then-Hampshire County, Virginia, sometime after 1740. Eventually, a community developed, which was also known as ""the Irish Settlement."" Initially a peaceful village, Paddy Town came under repeated attacks by Native Americans after French and Indian forces defeated Major General Edward Braddock west of Paddy Town in 1755. Patrick McCarty\'s son, Edward McCarty, built an iron furnace and foundry and a salt well, near present-day Armstrong Street.\nIn the early 19th century, the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O Canal) was constructed alongside the Potomac, from Washington, DC, to Cumberland, Maryland. Originally planned to reach the Ohio River, the canal never reached Paddy Town; after being overtaken by the railroad, the canal stopped as far west as Cumberland. By 1844, Paddy Town fell into decline, which reversed when the town received an economic boost in 1852 when the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, in search of a path through the Alleghenies, arrived. Sometime between 1855 and the start of the Civil War, the townsfolk renamed the village New Creek Station, after the creek that runs by it.\nIn 1861, the American Civil War came to New Creek Station in then-Hampshire County, Virginia, when the Union established Fort Fuller. The railroad that had been a blessing to the town ha', 'From World War II Memorial:\nThe World War II Memorial is a national memorial in the United States dedicated to Americans who served in the armed forces and as civilians during World War II. It is located on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.\nThe memorial consists of 56 granite pillars, decorated with bronze laurel wreaths, representing U.S. states and territories, and a pair of small triumphal arches for the Atlantic and Pacific theaters, surrounding an oval plaza and fountain. On its short axis is a memorial wall of gold stars representing the fallen, and opposite, a sloped and stepped entrance plaza leading up to the oval from 17th Street.  Its initial design was submitted by Austrian-American architect Friedrich St. Florian.\nOpened on April 29, 2004, it replaced the Rainbow Pool at the eastern end of the Reflecting Pool, between the Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Monument. Dedicated by President George W. Bush on May 29, 2004, the memorial is administered by the National Park Service under its National Mall and Memorial Parks group. More than 4.6 million people visited the memorial in 2018.\n\nOverview\nThe memorial consists of 56 granite pillars, each 17 feet (5.2 m) tall, arranged in a semicircle around a plaza with two 43-foot (13 m) triumphal arches on opposite sides.

What is the difference in years between the discovery of this asteroid and the discovery of the planet?', 'From Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey:\nThe Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey (PCAS) was an astronomical survey, initiated by American astronomers Eleanor Helin and Eugene Shoemaker at the U.S Palomar Observatory, California, in 1973. The program is responsible for the discovery of 95 near-Earth Objects including 17 comets, while the Minor Planet Center directly credits PCAS with the discovery of 20 numbered minor planets during 1993–1994. PCAS ran for nearly 25 years until June 1995. It had an international extension, INAS, and was the immediate predecessor of the outstandingly successful NEAT program.\n\nNotable discoveries\nThe first NEO discovered by PACS was (5496) 1973 NA, an Apollo asteroid with an exceptional orbital inclination of 68°, the most highly inclined minor planet known until 1999. In 1976, Eleanor Helin discovered 2062 Aten, the first of a new class of asteroids called the Aten asteroids with small orbits that are never far from Earth\'s orbit. As a result, these objects have a particularly high probability of colliding with the Earth. In 1979, Helin discovered an Apollo-type asteroid, that they later identified with the comet 4015 Wilson–Harrington. It was the first confirmation that a comet can evolve into an asteroid after it has degassed.\n\nList of discovered minor planets\nSee also\nBrian P.

It has a highly eccentric and inclined orbit during which it ranges from 34–101 astronomical units (5.1–15.1 billion kilometers; 3.2–9.4 billion miles) from the Sun. As of 2019, its distance from the Sun is 88 AU (13.2×10^9 km; 8.2×10^9 mi), and it is the sixth-farthest known Solar System object. According to the Deep Ecliptic Survey, Gonggong is in a 3:10 orbital resonance with Neptune, in which it completes three orbits around the Sun for every ten orbits completed by Neptune. Gonggong was discovered in July 2007 by American astronomers Megan Schwamb, Michael Brown, and David Rabinowitz at the Palomar Observatory, and the discovery was announced in January 2009.\nAt approximately 1,230 km (760 mi) in diameter, Gonggong is similar in size to Pluto's moon Charon, making it the fifth-largest known trans-Neptunian object (apart possibly from Charon). It may be sufficiently massive to be in hydrostatic equilibrium and therefore a dwarf planet. Gonggong's large mass makes retention of a tenuous atmosphere of methane just possible, though such an atmosphere would slowly escape into space. The object is named after Gònggōng, a Chinese water god responsible for chaos, floods and the tilt of the Earth. The name was chosen by its discoverers in 2019, when they hosted an online poll for the general public to help choose a name for the object, and the name Gonggong won.\nGonggong is red, likely due to the presence of organic compounds called tholins on its surface. Water ice is also present on its surface, which hints at a brief period of cryovolcanic activity in the distant past. With a rotation period of around 22 hours, Gonggong rotates slowly compared to other trans-Neptunian objects, which typically have periods of less than 12 hours. The slow rotation of Gonggong may have been caused by tidal forces from its natural satellite, named Xiangliu.\n\nHistory\nD"", 'From Charon (moon):\nCharon ( KAIR-on, -\u2060ən or  SHARR-ən), or (134340) Pluto I, is the largest of the five known natural satellites of the dwarf planet Pluto. It has a mean radius of 606 km (377 mi). Charon is the sixth-largest known trans-Neptunian object after Pluto, Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Gonggong. It was discovered in 1978 at the United States Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., using photographic plates taken at the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS).\nWith half the diameter and one-eighth the mass of Pluto, Charon is a very large moon in comparison to its parent body. Its gravitational influence is such that the barycenter of the Plutonian system lies outside Pluto, and the two bodies are tidally locked to each other. The dwarf planet systems Pluto–Charon and Eris–Dysnomia are the only known examples of mutual tidal locking in the Solar System, though it is likely that Orcus–Vanth is another.\nThe reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon is composed of tholins, organic macromolecules that may be essential ingredients of life.  These tholins were produced from methane, nitrogen, and related gases which may have been released by cryovolcanic eruptions on the moon, or may have been transferred over 19,000 km (12,000 mi) from the atmosphere of Pluto to the orbiting moon.\nThe New Horizons spacecraft is the only probe that has visited the Pluto system. It approached Charon to within 27,000 km (17,000 mi) in 2015.\n\nDiscovery\nCharon was discovered by United States Naval Observatory astronomer James Christy, using the 1.55-meter (61 in) telescope at United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS). On June 22, 1978, he had been examining highly magnified images of Pluto on photographic plates taken with the telescope two months prior. Christy noticed that a slight elongation appeared periodically. The bulge was confirmed on plates dating back to April 29, 1965. Subsequent observations of Pluto determined that the bulge was due to a smaller accompany']",49 years,The context does not include specific years for the discoveries of the asteroid and the planet by the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey.

More unusually, Le Monde is a daily newspaper published the afternoon before its cover date. For some publications, the cover date may not be found on the cover, but rather on an inside jacket or on an interior page.\n\nMagazines\nIn the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom, the standard practice is to display on magazine covers a date which is some weeks or months in the future from the publishing or release date. There are two reasons for this discrepancy: first, to allow magazines to continue appearing ""current"" to consumers even after they have been on sale for some time (since not all magazines will be sold immediately), and second, to inform newsstands when an unsold magazine can be removed from the stands and returned to the publishing company or be destroyed (in this case, the cover date is also the pull date).\nWeeklies (such as Time and Newsweek) are generally dated a week ahead. Monthlies (such as National Geographic) are generally dated two to three months ahead, and quarterlies are generally dated half a month ahead.\nIn other countries, the cover date usually matches more closely the date of publication, and may indeed be identical where weekly magazines are concerned.\nIn all markets, it is rare for monthly magazines to indicate a particular day of the month: thus issues are dated May 2016, and so on, whereas weekly magazines may be dated 17 May 2016.\n\nComic books\nThe general practice of most mainstream comic book companies since the creation of the comic book in the 1930s was to date individual issues by putting the name of a month (and much later the year as well) on the cover which was generally two months after the release date.

Of his writing style, Time observed: ""Whenever possible, Chesterton made his points with popular sayings, proverbs, allegories—first carefully turning them inside out."" His writings were an influence on Jorge Luis Borges, who compared his work with that of Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nBiography\nEarly life\nChesterton was born in Campden Hill in Kensington, London, on 29 May 1874. His father was Edward Chesterton, an estate agent, and his mother was Marie Louise, née Grosjean, of Swiss-French origin. Chesterton was baptised at the age of one month into the Church of England, though his family themselves were irregularly practising Unitarians. According to his autobiography, as a young man he became fascinated with the occult and, along with his brother Cecil, experimented with Ouija boards. He was educated at St Paul\'s School, then attended the Slade School of Art to become an illustrator. The Slade is a department of University College London, where Chesterton also took classes in literature, but he did not complete a degree in either subject. He married Frances Blogg in 1901; the marriage lasted the rest of his life. Chesterton credited Frances with leading him back to Anglicanism, though he later considered Anglicanism to be a ""pale imitation"". He entered in full communion with the Catholic Church in 1922.

Analogous names in other languages include Jean Lefèvre, Giovanni Ferrari, Ivan Kuznetsov, Sean McGowan, Hans Schmidt, Kovács János, etc.\n\nStereotypes associated with the name\n""Kowalski"" itself is a stereotypical Polish surname, despite being nearly half as common as the leader, Nowak. Polish philologist Mariusz Rutkowski explains this phenomenon by the additional fact of the high productivity of the surname\'s structure: the patronymic suffix -ski produces over 7,800 Polish surnames, with the runner-up being the suffix icz/ycz (about 1680 surnames).\nDue to its commonality, the surname ""Kowalski"" acquired some other connotations, which may be grouped into two classes, with close meanings: ""average, typical/stereotypical dweller of Poland"" and ""ordinary, mundane person"". It is often difficult to classify a specific metonymic usage of the surname Kowalski, because the first class is hyponymic with respect to the second one, i.e., an average person is also an ordinary one.\nThe metonymic reference is not restricted to Polish average persons: One may see the expressions such as ""Kowalskis of Albania"", ""German Jan Kowalski"", etc.\nA major difference between the two classes may be demonstrated by the following examples: ""An average Kowalski who uses the internet for purchases is in the age range of 31 to 40 years"".

It is mainly situated in the Himalayas, but also includes parts of the Indo-Gangetic Plain. It borders the Tibet Autonomous Region of China to the north, and India to the south, east, and west, while it is narrowly separated from Bangladesh by the Siliguri Corridor, and from Bhutan by the Indian state of Sikkim. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world\'s ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth.

In the middle of the first millennium BC, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born in Lumbini in southern Nepal. Parts of northern Nepal were intertwined with the culture of Tibet. The centrally located Kathmandu Valley is intertwined with the culture of Indo-Aryans, and was the seat of the prosperous Newar confederacy known as Nepal Mandala. The Himalayan branch of the ancient Silk Road was dominated by the valley\'s traders. The cosmopolitan region developed distinct traditional art and architecture. By the 18th century, the Gorkha Kingdom achieved the unification of Nepal. The Shah dynasty established the Kingdom of Nepal and later formed an alliance with the British Empire, under its Rana dynasty of premiers. The country was never colonised but served as a buffer state between Imperial China and British India. Parliamentary democracy was introduced in 1951 but was twice suspended by Nepalese monarchs, in 1960 and 2005.

Love played a very physical game, once leading the league with 327 penalty minutes and 40 fights during the 2002–03 WHL season, capturing a long-standing team record for single-season penalty minutes with the Broncos in the process. Love is regarded as one of the greatest Silvertips players of all time, and is the only person to have their jersey retired by the team.\nUndrafted at the NHL level, Love nonetheless managed to spend several years as a professional hockey player. During his professional career, Love played for seven different teams over six seasons, primarily in the American Hockey League (AHL). He spent time under an NHL contract with the Colorado Avalanche, but never played in the NHL. A hard-hitting defenceman and later left winger, Love found a place in the league due to his physical play, including posting 34 fights during the 2008–09 AHL season, more than any other professional hockey player in the world that year.\n\nEarly life\nLove was born on June 15, 1984, in Quesnel, British Columbia to parents Harley and Melanie Love.

The non-financial metric is similar to the price earnings ratio, but instead focuses on valuation against social impact, rather than projected earnings.\nThe ratio was founded in 2011 by Olinga Ta\'eed and a team of financial experts, in order to find a way of measuring financial investment against real social impact. It began as a university collaboration in the United Kingdom, before becoming an internationally recognized form of measurement, when the CCEG was founded.\nIn 2013, it was identified in a news article as ""the most rapidly adopted metric in the world"".\n\nHistory\nThe Social Earnings Ratio (S/E) is a form of measuring sentiment and converting it into financial value. The ratio began as an idea to develop a single number metric to measure social value. In November 2011, a university collaboration was formed to manage this development. Around 18 months later, the Centre for Citizenship, Enterprise and Governance (CCEG) was formed in April 2013, to act as the standards body to curate the ratio globally. The standards body would also be run as a non-profit. The Board for the CCEG was to include Professor Nick Petford, who was also the Vice-Chancellor at the University of Northampton.\nFollowing the establishment of the CCEG, Olinga Ta\'eed was the keynote speaker at the Global Citizen Forum. In early 2015, it was announced that Seratio would be launched as a spin-off organization to control the licensing of the Social Earnings Ratio platform. Barbara Mellish would be the CEO of Seratio.\nBy late 2015, the CCEG had over 37,500 members, including a number of key sustainability leaders. The UK Intellectual Property Office accepted the terms ""Social Earnings Ratio"", ""S/E Ratio"" and ""Seratio"" as having ""acquired a distinctive character as a result of the use made of it.""

He did not live to finish it, and had barely begun it by the time of his death in 1849.\n\nPlot summary\nThe story is told as a series of diary entries, the first being New Year\'s Day, 1796.  The setting is an island off the coast of Norway.\nOn January 1, the narrator records that it is his first day in the lighthouse, and records his annoyance at the fact that he had a difficult time getting the appointment to man it, even though he is of noble birth.  He records that a storm is in progress, and that the ship that brought him ""had a narrow escape"".  He also dwells on the concept of being alone, and how much he looks forward to spending time alone, just him and his dog Neptune, so he can write his book. He briefly comments that he hears some echo in the walls, thinking they may not be sturdy, but catches himself and claims that his worries are ""all nonsense"", alluding to a prophecy made by his friend DeGrat, who got him the appointment to the lighthouse.\nOn January 2, he describes the sea as being calm and uneventful, the wind having ""lulled about"", and expounds on his passion for being alone.\nOn January 3, he describes the day as being calm and placid and resolves to explore the lighthouse. He again begins to worry about the safety of the structure but tries to reassure himself.  The last line reads, ""The basis on which the structure rests seems to me to be chalk...""\nA heading for January 4 follows, but there is no text.\n\nComposition\nBiographer Kenneth Silverman believes Poe began writing ""The Light-House"" between May and August 1849. The work was never officially titled.\nIt is uncertain how the story would have ended and there is some debate if ""The Light-House"" was intended as a short story or a novel. Silverman speculates that the work might have been complete in its two-page form and the final blank entry implied the narrator\'s death.\nIt is likely the last fiction work Poe wrote', 'From The Scream:\nThe Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is  Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the anxiety of the human condition. Munch\'s work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist movement.\nMunch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun\'s light turned the clouds ""a blood red"". He sensed an ""infinite scream passing through nature"". Scholars have located the spot to a fjord overlooking Oslo and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky, ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister\'s commitment at a nearby lunatic asylum.\nMunch created two versions in paint and two in pastels, as well as a lithograph stone from which several prints survive. Both painted versions have been stolen, but since recovered. In 2012, one of the pastel versions commanded the highest nominal price paid for an artwork at a public auction at that time.\n\nSources of inspiration\nIn his diary in an entry headed ""Nice 22 January 1892"", Munch wrote:\n\nOne evening I was walking along a path, the city was on one side and the fjord below. I felt tired and ill. I stopped and looked out over the fjord – the sun was setting, and the clouds turning blood red. I sensed a scream passing through nature; it seemed to me that I heard the scream. I painted this picture, painted the clouds as actual blood. The color shrieked. This became The Scream.\nHe later described his inspiration for the image:\n\nI was walking along the road with two friends – the sun was setting – suddenly the sky turned blood red – I paused, feeling exhausted, and leaned on the fence – there was blood and tongues of fire above the blue-black fjord and the city ']",7,"The provided text does not mention Stephen Etnier or any novels that inspired him to pursue painting, so I cannot answer this question from the provided context.",-0.012743163853883743,False,4,

As the first African-American President of the United States, his race and culture played a prominent role, both positively and negatively.\nHis relative youth (47 when elected) has alternately resulted in him being praised for his freshness and criticized for his inexperience. His temperament and demeanor have been praised for perceived unflappability, but criticized for a perception of lacking emotional attachment.\n\nOrigins and identity\nRace and culture\nObama, who is biracial, self-identifies as African-American despite being black Kenyan and white American. His father was a black Kenyan from the Luo ethnic group and his mother was white of European descent, mainly of English lineage. Obama, who grew to adulthood after the Civil Rights Movement, had early life experiences that differed from most African American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in that movement. He was brought up in Honolulu, Hawaii, lived in Jakarta, Indonesia as a young child, and received a private prep school and Ivy League education.\nIn a March 2007 op-ed, African-American film critic David Ehrenstein of the Los Angeles Times said that Obama was an early popular contender for the presidency not because of his political record, but because whites viewed him as a kind of ""comic-book superhero"", who would selflessly solve white people\'s problems. Black commentators such as Stanley Crouch of the New York Daily News expressed mixed feelings about his racial identity, while others like Laura Washington (Chicago Sun-Times), Gary Younge (The Nation), and Clarence Page (Houston Chronicle) reported a general ambivalence among the black community about his authenticity as an African-American.\nIn January 2007, The End of Blackness author Debra Dickerson warned against drawing favorable cultural impli', ""From Frank Ledger:\nSir Joseph Francis Ledger (29 October 1899 – 8 April 1993), widely known as Frank Ledger, was a Western Australian businessman and philanthropist.

He was the third of nine children born to Edson Ledger and Annie Francis née Sumner. At age fourteen, he started an apprenticeship with his father's and uncle's engineering firm J. and E. Ledger, during which he gained diverse skills in general engineering, blacksmithing, and founding.\nLedger enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force on 4 May 1918, during World War I. The war concluded while he was still training in Victoria, and Ledger was discharged on 24 December. He worked in various engineering fields, including motor vehicles, whilst also attending night classes at Perth Technical School. In 1923, he married Gladys Muriel Lyons.\n\nFamily business\nAfter the death of his father in 1924, Ledger took on more responsibilities in the family business. The firm was officially incorporated as a company in September, marking the beginning of Ledger's long tenure at the helm. In response to the economic challenges of the Great Depression, Ledger expanded the business activities to include brickmaking, pottery, and manufacturing print machinery. He also expanded the business' premises, acquired additional land, and developed the sales side of the business. Ledger's leadership continued until 1965 when the company was sold to Mitchell Cotts, a British firm.\n\nIndustrial development\nDuring his career, Ledger played a pivotal role in the industrial landscape of Western Australia. Notably, he was the instigator and inaugural president of the Institute of Foundrymen in 1943, aimed at raising standards and promoting metallurgical advancements. His involvement extended to various associations, including the Metropoli"", ""From Heath Ledger:\nHeath Andrew Ledger (4 April 1979 – 22 January 2008) was an Australian actor.

His work consisted of 20 films in a variety of genres, including 10 Things I Hate About You (1999), The Patriot (2000), A Knight's Tale (2001), Monster's Ball (2001), Casanova (2005), Lords of Dogtown (2005), Brokeback Mountain (2005), Candy (2006), I'm Not There (2007), The Dark Knight (2008), and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (2009), the latter two of which were posthumously released. He also produced and directed music videos and aspired to be a film director.\nFor his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar in Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, he received nominations for the BAFTA Award, Screen Actors Guild Award, Golden Globe Award and the Academy Award for Best Actor, becoming the eighth-youngest nominee in the category at that time. In 2007, he played a fictional actor, Robbie Clark, one of six characters embodying aspects of Bob Dylan's life and persona in Todd Haynes' I'm Not There.\nLedger died in January 2008 from an accidental overdose as a result of prescription drug abuse.

The Hollywood Sign is located on its southern slope.\n\nHistory\nThe original unnamed peak was one of the ""three sisters"" along with Cahuenga and Burbank peaks, the current flattened top being a result of silent movie pioneer Mack Sennett\'s unfulfilled plans to build an elaborate home on the property.\n To advertise the new Beachwood Canyon real estate development, the developers, including Sennett and Los Angeles Times publisher Harry Chandler, ordered a huge wooden sign built atop what is now known as Mount Lee. The mountain is named after early Los Angeles car dealer and radio station owner Don Lee. Lee, a one-time bicycle shop owner who became a protégé of Los Angeles pioneer businessman Earle C. Anthony, purchased his Los Angeles radio station KHJ from Chandler in 1927.\n\nFour years later Lee began experimenting with television using call letters W6XAO. Studios were on the seventh floor of a building at Seventh and Bixel near his Cadillac dealership.  A few years later, the transmitter was moved atop what is now called Mount Lee. An early reference to this name is in a June 1939 article in a magazine published by the California Chamber of Commerce: ""Lee has bought a 20-acre site on a mountain top at the eastern boundary of Griffith Park, widening the transmission field of the Don Lee equipment to take in new thousands of homes in the Hollywood hills and the San Fernando Valley. The site is one and a half times higher than the top floor of the Empire State Building in New York. Mount Lee is thus the highest television location in the world. The transmitter is being rebuilt for installation on the mountain.""\nAccording to Wikimapia the immediate seller was not the original development company, but Sennett personally, ""who wasn\'t doing too well in the post-silent Hollywood era and really needed the money.""

It is the westernmost range in the Transverse Ranges.\nThe range is a large fault block of Cenozoic age created by the movements of the Santa Ynez Fault. A very narrow range, the Santa Ynez Mountains rise quickly on its north side and drops off equally dramatically along the range's south face along the Gaviota Coast. The Santa Ynez Mountains begin as a series of volcanic hills near Point Arguello, and gradually transitions eastward into a single, well-defined ridge extending from Gaviota Peak to Matilija Creek. The range is approximately contiguous with the Topatopa Mountains beyond to the east, which terminates abruptly at Sespe Creek.\nThe climate of the range is Mediterranean with most of the precipitation falling between November and March. Most of the range lies in the California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion. At the crest and on the north slope, the rainier regions support extensive oak woodlands, mixed with other broadleafed species such as madrone, sycamore and bay laurel, along with some conifers, primarily Coulter pines.\n\nGeography\nThe mountains are principally in Santa Barbara County, with an eastward extension into Ventura County, and are unusual in being an entirely east–west trending mountain range—one of the few in the United States. This is attributed in part to clockwise rotations of crustal blocks 90° or more since the early Miocene or about 17 million years ago. The range is mostly within Los Padres National Forest.\nThe southern slopes of the range drop off into a series of alluvial plains which make up the Gaviota Coast along the Santa Barbara Channel.

The original CD was packaged in a metal box (a trend among Chain Reaction releases) which reportedly damaged the disc (a common complaint regarding Chain Reaction\'s CD issues).

He is regarded as one of the most significant and influential American singers and songwriters of the 20th century. Williams recorded 55 singles that reached the top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, five of which were released posthumously, and 12 of which reached No.1.\nBorn and raised in Alabama, Williams learned guitar from African-American blues musician Rufus Payne. Both Payne and Roy Acuff significantly influenced his musical style. After winning an amateur talent contest, Williams began his professional career in Montgomery in the late 1930s playing on local radio stations and at area venues such as school houses, movie theaters, and bars. He formed the Drifting Cowboys backup band, which was managed by his mother, and dropped out of school to devote his time to his career. Because his alcoholism made him unreliable, he was fired and rehired several times by radio station WSFA, and had trouble replacing several of his band members who were drafted during World War II.\nIn 1944, Williams married Audrey Sheppard, who competed with his mother to control his career. After recording ""Never Again"" and ""Honky Tonkin\'"" with Sterling Records, he signed a contract with MGM Records. He released the hit single ""Move It On Over"" in 1947 and joined the Louisiana Hayride radio program. The next year he released a cover of ""Lovesick Blues"", which quickly reached number one on Billboard\'s Top Country & Western singles chart and propelled him to stardom on the Grand Ole Opry. Although unable to read or notate music to any significant degree, he wrote such iconic hits as ""Your Cheatin\' Heart"", ""Hey, Good Lookin\'"", and ""I\'m So Lonesome I Could Cry"". In 1952, Audrey divorced him and he married Billie Jean Horton. He was dismissed by the Grand Ole Opry because of his unreliability and alcoholism.\nYears of back pain, alcoholism, and prescription drug abuse sev', ""From Magneto (Marvel Comics):\nMagneto (; birth name: Max Eisenhardt; alias: Erik Lehnsherr German pronunciation: [ˈeːʁɪk ˈleːnshɛʁ] and Magnus) is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, commonly in association with the X-Men. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in The X-Men #1 (cover-dated September 1963) as an adversary of the X-Men.\nMagneto is a powerful mutant, one of a fictional subspecies of humanity born with superhuman abilities, who has the ability to generate and control magnetic fields. Magneto regards mutants as evolutionarily superior to humans and rejects the possibility of peaceful human-mutant coexistence; he initially aimed to conquer the world to enable mutants, whom he refers to as Homo superior, to replace humans as the dominant species, and occasionally advocated for human genocide. Writers have since fleshed out his origins and motivations, revealing him to be a Holocaust survivor whose extreme methods and cynical philosophy derive from his determination to protect mutants from suffering a similar fate to the European Jews at the hands of a world that fears and persecutes them. He was once a friend of Professor X, the leader of the X-Men, but their different philosophies sometimes cause a rift in their friendship. Magneto's role in comics has progressed from supervillain to antihero to superhero, having served as an occasional ally and member of the X-Men, even leading the New Mutants for a time as headmaster of the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters.\nWriter Chris Claremont, who originated Magneto's backstory, modeled the character on then-Israeli opposition leader Menachem Begin, with later commentators comparing the character with the American civil rights leader Malcolm X and Jewish Defense League founder Meir Kahane.\nIan McKellen has portrayed Magneto in various films since X-Men in 2000, while Michael Fassbender has portrayed a younger version of the character in the prequel films s"", 'From 31st Blue Dragon Film Awards:\nThe 31st Blue Dragon Film Awards ceremony was held on November 26, 2010, at the National Theater of Korea in Seoul.

Its headquarters moved to Dublin, Ohio, on January 29, 2006. As of December 31, 2018, Wendy\'s was the world\'s third-largest hamburger fast-food chain with 6,711 locations, following McDonald’s and Burger King. On September 29, 2008, the company merged with Triarc Companies Inc., the publicly traded parent company of Arby\'s.\nAs of November 2, 2023, there were 7,166 Wendy\'s outlets, of which 415 are company-owned and 6,751 franchised, 83% of which are in the United States. The company specifies stores\' standards; owners control opening hours, decor, and staff uniforms and pay.\nThe chain serves square hamburger patties on circular buns, sea salt fries, and the Frosty, soft ice cream mixed with starches. The food menu consists primarily of hamburgers, chicken sandwiches, and French fries. The company discontinued its Big Classic signature sandwich.\n\nHistory\nWendy\'s hamburgers are based on those of Kewpee Hamburgers in Dave Thomas\'s home town, Kalamazoo, Michigan; Kewpee sold square hamburgers and thick malt shakes. Thomas founded Wendy\'s in Columbus, Ohio, in 1969, selling square patties with corners that stuck out of the circular bun, giving the impression of plentiful meat. The Columbus location later added a Tim Hortons. It was closed on March 2, 2007, after 38 years of business, due to declining sales. Basketball star John Havlicek, an Ohio State University alumnus, was one of Thomas\'s earliest investors, which allowed him to retire comfortably.\nThomas named the restaurant after his fourth child Melinda Lou ""Wendy"" Thomas. Photographs of her were on display at the original Wendy\'s restaurant until it closed. Thomas wrote that he regretted naming the restaurant after his daughter because once it became a fast food empire she ""lost some of her privacy"" with many people assuming she was the official company spokesperson.

All four victims were shot dead seemingly at random. Prior to his arrest, the media called the killer the Seminole Heights serial killer.\nOn November 28, 2017, police arrested Donaldson after he handed a pistol in a bag to his manager at the McDonald\'s where he worked and instructed her to bury the bag without opening it. Subsequent investigation revealed that the pistol may have fired the bullets used in the killings and that Donaldson\'s cell phone had been in the vicinity of the killings at the relevant times, while a search of Donaldson\'s vehicle found clothing similar to that seen in surveillance footage of the killing.\nOn that basis, police charged Donaldson with four counts of murder. Donaldson stated that the pistol belonged to him but did not state whether he had committed the killings. Donaldson was indicted on the charges on December 7, 2017. He pleaded not guilty to all charges five days later.\nOn January 23, 2018, Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren announced his office would seek the death penalty against Donaldson. Donaldson\'s trial was set for August 2023. On May 1, 2023, Donaldson pleaded guilty in the murders and was sentenced to four consecutive life sentences without parole.\n\nEarly life\nHowell was a basketball player for the St. John\'s University St. John\'s Red Storm men\'s basketball from 2011 to 2012.\n\nVictims\nBenjamin Edward Mitchell\nA man was shot and killed at about 12:00 noon on October 9, 2017, as he was waiting at a bus stop near North 15th Street and East Frierson Avenue in the Seminole Heights neighborhood.

The web games in the series were initially impacted by the shutdown of Adobe Flash December 31, 2020, but can be played on websites including Cool Math Games using Flash Player emulators such as AwayFL and Ruffle.\n\nGameplay\nPlaying as either a male, female, or custom character, players are tasked with running one of Papa Louie's various fast food restaurants. The time management games (or Gameria's) involve 3 or 4 stations: One for taking orders, 2 for cooking and preparing food, and a final station for plating and serving the finished meal. Players are tasked with accurately and quickly completing customers' orders, which awards them tips and points that contribute to the players rank. Better orders also give stars that can promote a customer to Bronze, Silver, and Gold, which increases the tips and points they give. In later games, getting enough points earns tickets that can be used to play minigames, which reward tips, clothing, and decor. \nSimilarly to how a customer’s tip depends on the player’s performance, the tipping system highlighted in the Papa Louie series underscores a broader issue that reflects the real-world dynamics of service-industry practices, where workers experience financial hardship and continue to rely on customer satisfaction for compensation. \nUnique customers include closers, who give complex orders at the end of the day; Jojo the Food Critic, who orders something new each time and gives a Blue Ribbon that temporarily boosts tips if served properly, and in mobile versions, customers can order via a delivery phone.

They were mainly concerned by their political disadvantage in comparison to the more ancient part of the canton and the unwillingness of conservative elements to reform the canton's constitution.\nThe remaining half-canton was called Inner Schwyz; it comprised the older part of the canton as well as the community of Wollerau.\nIn January 1831 a provisional government of the half-canton was instituted at a people's assembly at Lachen. After further negotiations, the constitution was then agreed in April 1832. The half-canton was provisionally recognised by the Confederal government in April 1833, and Joachim Schmid was recognised as the official delegate to the federal parliament.\nIn July 1833, [Inner] Schwyz invaded and occupied the district of Küssnacht under Colonel Theodor Ab-Yberg. The Confederal government then intervened militarily and forced the parties to unite.

Traditionally, First Nations in Canada were peoples who lived south of the tree line, and mainly south of the Arctic Circle. There are 634 recognized First Nations governments or bands across Canada. Roughly half are located in the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia.\nUnder Charter jurisprudence, First Nations are a ""designated group"", along with women, visible minorities, and people with physical or mental disabilities. First Nations are not defined as a visible minority by the criteria of Statistics Canada.\nNorth American indigenous peoples have cultures spanning thousands of years. Some of their oral traditions accurately describe historical events, such as the Cascadia earthquake of 1700 and the 18th-century Tseax Cone eruption. Written records began with the arrival of European explorers and colonists during the Age of Discovery in the late 15th century. European accounts by trappers, traders, explorers, and missionaries give important evidence of early contact culture. In addition, archeological and anthropological research, as well as linguistics, have helped scholars piece together an understanding of ancient cultures and historic peoples.\n\nTerminology\nCollectively, First Nations (Indians), Inuit, and Métis peoples constitute Indigenous peoples in Canada, Indigenous peoples of the Americas, or ""first peoples"". First Nation as a term became officially used by the government beginning in 1980s to replace the term Indian band in referring to groups of Indians with common government and language. The First Nations people had begun to identify by this term during 1970s activism, in order to avoid using the word Indian, which some considered offensive. No legal definition of the term exists.\nSome Indigenous peoples in Canada have also adopted the term First Nation to replace the word band in the formal name of their community. A ', ""From History of New Zealand:\nThe human history of New Zealand can be dated back to between 1320 and 1350 CE, when the main settlement period started, after it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture. Like other Pacific cultures, Māori society was centred on kinship links and connection with the land but, unlike them, it was adapted to a cool, temperate environment rather than a warm, tropical one. The first European explorer known to have visited New Zealand was the Dutch navigator Abel Tasman, on 13 December 1642. In 1643 he charted the west coast of the North Island, his expedition then sailed back to Batavia without setting foot on New Zealand soil. British explorer James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the first of his three voyages, was the first European to circumnavigate and map New Zealand. From the late 18th century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and adventurers. The period from Polynesian settlement to Cook's arrival is New Zealand's prehistoric period, a time before written records began. Use or otherwise of indigenous oral history as recorded history is a matter of academic debate. Depending on definitions, the period from 1642 to 1769 can be called New Zealand's protohistory rather than prehistory: Tasman's recording of Māori was isolated and scant.\nOn 6 February 1840, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between representatives of the United Kingdom and various Māori chiefs, initially at Waitangi and over the following weeks at other locations across the country. On 21 May 1840, New Zealand entered the British Empire when Lieutenant-Governor William Hobson proclaimed British sovereignty at Kororāreka (Russell). Disputes over the differing versions of the Treaty and settler desire to acquire land from Māori led to the New Zealand Wars from 1843. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the 19th century and into the early part of the next century.

Over the years, the collection grew. It was housed inadequately in wooden buildings at Kandalore, and by the late 1980s it was becoming clear that a new home would be needed. Wipper transferred control of his historic collection in 1994 to the organization now called the Canadian Canoe Museum. The museum now holds the largest collection of its kind, with more than 600 canoes and kayaks, and a thousand related artifacts.  The museum opened its doors to the public at its new location, a former outboard motor factory, on Canada Day in 1997.\nIn May 2006, Prince Andrew, as a member of the Canadian Royal Family, accepted the invitation to become the royal patron of the museum, and visited on May 11 to celebrate its 10th anniversary. He also donated three canoes, originally built in the area of Peterborough, and gifted to the Royal Family between 1947 and 1981, on long-term loan.\nTransport of the collection to a new facility still under construction began in July 2023.

Each of the 13 players is assigned a position, normally with a standardised number, which reflects their role in attack and defence, although players can take up any position at any time.\nPlayers are divided into two general types, forwards and backs. Forwards are generally chosen for their size and strength. They are expected to run with the ball, to attack, and to make tackles. Forwards are required to improve the team's field position thus creating space and time for the backs. Backs are usually smaller and faster, though a big, fast player can be of advantage in the backs. Their roles require speed and ball-playing skills, rather than just strength, to take advantage of the field position gained by the forwards. Typically forwards tend to operate in the centre of the field, while backs operate nearer to the touch-lines, where more space can usually be found.\n\nNames and numbering\nThe laws of the game recognise standardised numbering of positions. The starting side normally wear the numbers corresponding to their positions, only changing in the case of substitutions and position shifts during the game. In some competitions, such as Super League, players receive a squad number to use all season, no matter what positions they play in.\nThe positions and the numbers are defined by the game's laws as:\n\nBacks\n1 Full back\n2 Right wing\n3 Right centre\n4 Left centre\n5 Left wing\n6 Stand-off half (Predominately used in the Northern hemisphere) or Five-eighth (Elsewhere)\n7 Scrum half (Predominately used in the Northern hemisphere) or Half-back\nForwards\n8 Prop (Front Row Forward)\n9 Hooker or Dummy-half\n10 Prop (Front Row Forward)\n11 Second Row Forward\n12 Second Row Forward\n13 Lock Forward or Loose Forward\nIn practice, the term 'front row forward' is used less frequently than the term 'Prop' of which a team has two.

Hiyō was torpedoed in mid-1943 and spent three months under repair. She spent most of the next six months training and ferrying aircraft before returning to combat. She was sunk by a gasoline-vapour explosion caused by an American torpedo hit during the Battle of the Philippine Sea on 20 June 1944 with the loss of 247 officers and ratings, about a fifth of her complement.\n\nDesign and description\nThe ship was ordered as the fast luxury passenger liner Izumo Maru by Nippon Yusen Kaisha (Japan Mail Steamship Company) in late 1938. In exchange for a Navy Ministry subsidy of 60% of her building costs, she was designed to be converted to an aircraft carrier in the event of war. The designs of Izumo Maru and her sister ship Kashiwara Maru were based on the German ocean liner SS Bremen, although they were only about half that ship\'s size at 27,700 gross register tons (GRT). If completed as designed, they would have been the largest ocean liners in Japan. The ships were designed to carry a total of 890 passengers; 220 first class, 120 second class and 550 third class.\nAfter her conversion, Hiyō had a length of 220 metres (721 ft 9 in) overall. She had a beam of 26.7 metres (87 ft 7 in) and a draught of 8.15 metres (26 ft 9 in). She displaced 24,150 tonnes (23,770 long tons) at standard load. Her crew ranged from 1,187 to 1,224 officers and ratings.\nThe ship was fitted with a pair of Mit', 'From Japanese aircraft carrier Shin\'yō:\nShin\'yō (神鷹) ""Divine Hawk"") was an escort carrier operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy, converted from the German ocean liner Scharnhorst. The liner had been trapped in Kure, Japan following the outbreak of World War II in Europe, which prevented any attempt for the ship to return to Germany. The Japanese Navy then purchased the ship, and after the Battle of Midway in June 1942, decided to convert her into an aircraft carrier. Conversion work lasted from 1942 to late 1943, and Shin\'yō was commissioned into the Japanese Navy in November 1943. After entering service, Shin\'yō was employed as a convoy escort in the western Pacific. She served in this capacity for less than a year; in November 1944, the US submarine Spadefish torpedoed Shin\'yō while she was en route to Singapore. As many as four torpedoes hit the ship and detonated her aviation fuel tanks. The resulting explosion destroyed the ship and killed most of her crew.\n\nBackground and conversion\nScharnhorst was a passenger ship operated by Norddeutscher Lloyd in the 1930s. She was trapped in Japan after the outbreak of World War II in Europe in September 1939. The Japanese Navy purchased the ship on 7 February 1942, under the agreement they would pay Norddeutscher Lloyd twice the value of the ship after the end of the war. The ship was intended for use as a troop ship, but after the Japanese defeat at the Battle of Midway, the Navy decided to convert her into an escort carrier.\nConversion work on Scharnhorst began in September 1942 in the Kure Navy Dockyard. Steel from the uncompleted hull of the canceled fourth Yamato-class battleship was used in the conversion process. Work lasted until December 1943, and the rebuilt ship was commissioned into the Japanese Navy on 15 December 1943. Scharnhorst\'s design was similar to the Japanese passenger liners of the Nitta Maru class, which were also converted into the Taiyō-class escort carriers, so her conversion followed a similar plan.

Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores, but can also be found as standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal bore, or wave pools.\nThe term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance. There are several types of boards. The Moche of Peru would often surf on reed craft, while the native peoples of the Pacific surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such water craft. Ancient cultures often surfed on their belly and knees, while the modern-day definition of surfing most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.\nAnother prominent form of surfing is body boarding, where a surfer rides the wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee (one foot and one knee on the board), or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats) and using foils. Body surfing, in which the wave is caught and ridden using the surfer's own body rather than a board, is very common and is considered by some surfers to be the purest form of surfing. The closest form of body surfing using a board is a handboard which normally has one strap over it to fit on one hand. Surfers who body board, body surf, or handboard feel more drag as they move through the water than stand up surfers do. This holds body surfers into a more turbulent part of the wave (often completely submerged by whitewater). In contrast, surfers who instead ride a hydrofoil feel substantially less drag and may ride unbroken waves in the open ocean.\nThree major subdivisions within stand-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several "", ""From List of world records in swimming:\nThe world records in swimming are ratified by World Aquatics (formerly known as FINA), the international governing body of swimming.

A superlative construction expresses the greatest quality, quantity, or degree relative to all other comparators.\nThe associated grammatical category is degree of comparison. The usual degrees of comparison are the positive, which simply denotes a property (as with the English words big and fully); the comparative, which indicates greater degree (as bigger and more fully); and the superlative, which indicates greatest degree (as biggest and most fully). Some languages have forms indicating a very large degree of a particular quality (called elative in Semitic linguistics). Other languages (e.g. English) can express lesser degree, e.g. beautiful, less beautiful, least beautiful.\nThe comparative degrees are frequently associated with adjectives and adverbs because these words take the -er suffix or modifying word more or less. (e.g., faster, more intelligent, less wasteful). Comparison can also, however, appear when no adjective or adverb is present, for instance with nouns (e.g., more men than women).

This argument posits that individuals essentially engage in a life-defining gamble regarding the belief in the existence of God.\nPascal contends that a rational person should adopt a lifestyle consistent with the existence of God and actively strive to believe in God. The reasoning behind this stance lies in the potential outcomes: if God does not exist, the individual incurs only finite losses, potentially sacrificing certain pleasures and luxuries. However, if God does indeed exist, they stand to gain immeasurably, as represented for example by an eternity in Heaven in Abrahamic tradition, while simultaneously avoiding boundless losses associated with an eternity in Hell.\nThe original articulation of this wager can be found in Pascal\'s posthumously published work titled Pensées (""Thoughts""), which comprises a compilation of previously unpublished notes. Notably, Pascal\'s wager is significant as it marks the initial formal application of decision theory, existentialism, pragmatism, and voluntarism.\nCritics of the wager question the ability to provide definitive proof of God\'s existence. The argument from inconsistent revelations highlights the presence of various belief systems, each claiming exclusive access to divine truths. Additionally, the argument from inauthentic belief raises concerns about the genuineness of faith in God if solely motivated by potential benefits and losses.\n\nThe wager\nThe wager uses the following logic (excerpts from Pensées, part III, §233):\n\nGod is, or God is not. Reason cannot decide between the two alternatives\nA Game is being played... where heads or tails will turn up\nYou must wager (it is not optional)\nLet us weigh the gain and the loss in wagering that God is. Let us estimate these two chances. If you gain, you gain all; if you lose, you lose nothing\nWager, then, without', 'From For Your Eyes Only (film):\nFor Your Eyes Only is a 1981 spy film directed by John Glen (in his feature directorial debut) and produced by Albert R. Broccoli. The film stars Roger Moore as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond, and co-stars Carole Bouquet, Chaim Topol, Lynn-Holly Johnson and Julian Glover.\nThe twelfth film in the James Bond franchise produced by Eon Productions, For Your Eyes Only was written by Richard Maibaum and Michael G. Wilson. Although the script is principally based on two Ian Fleming short stories, ""For Your Eyes Only"" and ""Risico"", some elements of the plot were also inspired by the novels Live and Let Die, Goldfinger and On Her Majesty\'s Secret Service. The film follows Bond as he attempts to locate a missile command system while becoming tangled in a web of deception spun by rival Greek businessmen along with Melina Havelock, a woman seeking to avenge the murder of her parents.\nAfter the science-fiction-focused Moonraker, the producers wanted a return to the style of the early Bond films and the works of 007 creator Fleming. For Your Eyes Only followed a grittier, more realistic approach and a narrative theme of revenge and its consequences, rather than the fantasy narrative of Moonraker. Filming locations included Greece, Italy and the United Kingdom, while underwater footage was shot in the Bahamas. Sheena Easton performed the title theme song.\nFor Your Eyes Only was released in the UK on 24 June 1981 and in the US two days later; it received a mixed-to-positive critical reception. The film\'s reputation has improved over time, with reviewers praising the more serious tone in comparison to previous entries in the series. The film was a financial success, generating $195.3 million worldwide. This was the final Bond film to be distributed solely by United Artists; the company was absorbed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer soon after this film\'s release.\n\nPlot\nThe British information-gathering vessel St Georges, which holds the Automatic Targeting Attack Communicator (ATAC), the s']",They're both made in Bath,"The provided text does not mention Lose Your Way by the British rock band Love Amongst Ruin or Sally Lunn Buns.

In 1922, he was apprehended at a Wellington suburban property and in 1923 found guilty of murder and executed. His wife, Martha Elizabeth Cooper, was acquitted.\n\nEarly life\nDaniel Cooper was born to Elizabeth Ure and George Cooper, in Burns, Otago on 18 October 1881. Later in life, he became a builder, Cooper had two periods of contact with the police involving theft, once in Oamaru in 1902, and again in Palmerston North in 1907. By 1907, he had settled in Awamangu, Otago and married Marion Burns. The couple were itinerant and shifted to New Plymouth and then Gore, Southland, in 1916. By then, Cooper had joined the Seventh-day Adventist Church and sold a booklet entitled The Practical Guide to Good Health.\nTragedy struck when Marion died on 18 July 1917, in her eighth month of pregnancy. Although the initial diagnosis was pericarditis, the New Zealand Police re-investigated the case in 1923, after Cooper was apprehended for suspected murder. Family friends expressed doubt about the circumstances of Marion\'s death; given that she was being treated for goitre with mercuric iodide, some argued that it was possible that he had intentionally overdosed his first wife with that medication.\n\n""The Newlands Baby Farmer"" trial and execution\nGiven suspicions about his extracurricular activities occasioned by the death of his wife and other rumoured activities, Cooper was expelled from the Seventh-day Adventist Church of New Zealand on 2 January 1918, shortly after he had married his second wife, Martha (born 20 December 1893), a former book purchaser.

Most viewers in Canada have access to at least one U.S.-based Fox affiliate, either over the air or through a pay television provider, although Fox's National Football League broadcasts and most of its prime time programming are subject to simultaneous substitution regulations for pay television providers imposed by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to protect rights held by domestically based networks.\nFox is named after the film studio that was originally called 20th Century Fox (the network's corporate sibling prior to that studio's acquisition by The Walt Disney Company) and after the producer William Fox, who had founded one of the film studio's predecessors, Fox Film, before it was merged with 20th Century Pictures in 1935. Fox is a member of the North American Broadcasters Association and the National Association of Broadcasters.\n\nHistory\nOrigins\n20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios) had been involved in television production as early as the 1950s, producing several syndicated programs. Followin"", 'From X-Men: The Animated Series:\nX-Men: The Animated Series, also known as X-Men, is an animated superhero television series aired in the United States for five seasons from October 31, 1992, to September 20, 1997, on Fox\'s Fox Kids programming block. It was Marvel Comics\' second attempt at an animated X-Men television series after the pilot X-Men: Pryde of the X-Men was not picked up. Set in the same fictional universe as Spider-Man (1994–1998), Earth-92131, it was followed by a revival, X-Men \'97, which began airing on March 20, 2024, on Disney+ to critical acclaim.\n\nProduction\nIn March 1990, Margaret Loesch (who had previously worked as president and chief executive officer at Marvel Productions) became head of Fox Children\'s Network. Having championed the Pryde of the X-Men pilot in 1989, she ordered 13 episodes of X-Men. Saban Entertainment was contracted to produce the show and hired a small studio, Graz Entertainment, to produce episodes because, at the time, they lacked sufficient staff to handle in-house production. Mark Edward Edens and Eric Lewald were to write the show, with the two dividing the job between Edens as head writer and Lewald as story editor. The voice work was done through Canadian studios, and South Korean studio AKOM was hired to animate episodes. X-Men was initially set to premiere over Labor Day weekend in September; however, due to production delays, it was delayed to the end of October. When AKOM turned in the first episode, it contained several animation errors, which they refused to fix. Because of time constraints, the episode was aired unfinished; when Fox re-aired the pilot in early 1993, the errors were corrected. The second episode was submitted just before the deadline, with 50 scenes missing and a single day reserved for editing. The two-part episode ""Night of the Sentinels"" originally aired as a ""sneak preview"" on October 31.\nBecause of the production delays and animation errors, Fox threatened to sever AKOM\'s contracts.

The event gives its name to the Vesuvian type of volcanic eruption, characterised by columns of hot gases and ash reaching the stratosphere, although the event also included pyroclastic flows associated with Pelean eruptions.\nThe event destroyed several Roman towns and settlements in the area. Pompeii and Herculaneum, obliterated and buried underneath massive pyroclastic surges and ashfall deposits, are the most famous examples. Archaeological excavations have revealed much of the towns and the lives of the inhabitants leading to the area becoming the Vesuvius National Park and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe total population of both cities was over 20,000. The remains of over 1,500 people have been found at Pompeii and Herculaneum. The total death toll from the eruption remains unknown.\n\nPrecursor earthquakes\nA major earthquake caused widespread destruction around the Bay of Naples, particularly to Pompeii, on February 5, 62 AD. Some of the damage had still not been repaired when the volcano erupted in 79 AD.\nAnother smaller earthquake took place in 64 AD; it was recorded by Suetonius in his biography of Nero, and by Tacitus in Annales because it took place while Nero was in Naples performing for the first time in a public theater. Suetonius recorded that the emperor continued singing through the earthquake until he had finished his song, while Tacitus wrote that the theater collapsed shortly after being evacuated.\nMinor earthquakes were reported in the four days before the 79 AD eruption, but the warnings we', ""From List of World Heritage Sites in Italy:\nThe United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage Sites are places of importance to cultural or natural heritage as described in the UNESCO World Heritage Convention, established in 1972. Cultural heritage consists of monuments (such as architectural works, monumental sculptures, or inscriptions), groups of buildings, and sites (including archaeological sites). Natural features (consisting of physical and biological formations), geological and physiographical formations (including habitats of threatened species of animals and plants), and natural sites which are important from the point of view of science, conservation or natural beauty, are defined as natural heritage. Italy ratified the convention on June 23, 1978.\nAs of 2024, Italy has 60 listed sites, making it the state party with the most World Heritage Sites, just above China (59). The first site in Italy, the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica, was listed at the 3rd Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairo and Luxor, Egypt, in 1979. Twenty-five Italian sites were added during the 1990s, including 10 sites added at the 21st session held in Naples in 1997. Italy has served as a member of the World Heritage Committee five times, 1978–1985, 1987–1993, 1993–1999, 1999–2001, and 2021–2025.\nOut of Italy's 60 heritage sites, 54 are cultural and 6 are natural. Seven sites are transnational. The Historic Centre of Rome is shared with the Vatican; the Monte San Giorgio and Rhaetian Railway  with Switzerland; the Venetian Works of Defence with Croatia and Montenegro; the Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps with 5 other countries; The Great Spa Towns of Europe with 6 other countries; and the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and Other Regions of Europe are shared with 17 other countries.

This nation was visited by the 5th Cavalry Regiment (US) in 1901.', ""From 1960 Winter Olympics:\nThe 1960 Winter Olympics (officially the VIII Olympic Winter Games and also known as Squaw Valley 1960) were a winter multi-sport event held from February 18 to 28, 1960, at the Squaw Valley Resort (now known as Palisades Tahoe) in Squaw Valley (now known as Olympic Valley), California, United States. The resort was chosen to host the Games at the 1956 meeting of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Squaw Valley was an undeveloped resort in 1955, so the infrastructure and all of the venues were built between 1956 and 1960 at a cost of US$80,000,000 (equivalent to $823,937,008 in 2023). The layout was designed to be intimate, allowing spectators and competitors to reach most of the venues on foot.\nThe 1960 Winter Games hosted athletes from 30 nations, competing in four sports and 27 events. Biathlon and women's speed skating made their Olympic debuts. Bobsled was not on the Winter Olympic program for the only time; the organizers had decided the events did not warrant the cost of building a bobsled venue after a poll indicated that only nine countries were planning to participate. These Olympics became the first to be televised live, making them accessible to millions of viewers in real time, and introduced multiple technological innovations, including instant replay.\n\nHost city selection\nSquaw Valley, now called Palisades Tahoe, was a struggling ski resort with minimal facilities, which made its selection to host the 1960 Winter Olympics a surprise.  Wayne Poulsen and Alexander Cushing were inspired to bid for the Olympics by a newspaper article mentioning that Reno, Nevada, and Anchorage, Alaska, had expressed interest in the Games. Poulsen, president of the Squaw Valley Development Company, petitioned California Governor Goodwin Knight to support a bid to host the Olympic Games. Knight's administration agreed and recommended that the California Legislature appropriate $1 million to the effort.\nBased on the financial support received from the State of Califor"", 'From Tropical nations at the Winter Olympics:\nSeveral tropical nations have participated in the Winter Olympics despite not having the climate for winter sports. Partly because of that, their entries are a subject of human interest stories during the Games. No tropical nation has ever won a Winter Olympic medal. \nThe first warm-weather, but not fully tropical, nation participating in the Winter Olympics was Mexico. Much of Mexico is at a latitude north of the Tropic of Cancer, and most of the country has a subtropical highland or semi-arid climate, so it is not exclusively a tropical nation.  Nonetheless, Mexico made its Winter Olympic debut at the 1928 Winter Olympics with a five-man bobsleigh team that finished eleventh of twenty-three entrants. Mexico did not return again to the Winter Games until the 1984 Winter Olympics.\nThe first truly tropical nation to compete in the Winter Olympic Games was the Philippines, who sent two alpine skiers to the 1972 Winter Olympics in Sapporo, Japan. Ben Nanasca placed 42nd in giant slalom skiing (out of 73 entrants), and Juan Cipriano did not finish.  In slalom skiing, neither skier was able to finish. Costa Rica became the second tropical nation to participate at the Winter Games, in the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, where Arturo Kinch also competed in alpine skiing events.  Kinch would continue to compete for Costa Rica at three more Winter Games, including the 2006 Winter Olympics at age 49. There he finished 96th in the 15 km cross-country skiing event, ahead of only Prawat Nagvajara of Thailand, another tropical nation.\nThe 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada attracted many tropical nations, including Costa Rica, Fiji, Guam, Guatemala, Jamaica, Netherlands Antilles, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. The Jamaica bobsleigh team became a fan favorite at these Games and were later the inspiration of the 1993 motion picture Cool Runnings.

Its NOC since 1975 is the Philippine Olympic Committee (POC). Prior to that date, the Philippines was represented by the POC's predecessor, the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation which was founded in 1911. The Philippines is a recognized member of the International Olympic Committee since 1929.\nFilipino athletes have won a total of eighteen Olympic medals (as of 2024 Summer Olympics), with boxing as the top medal-producing sport. On July 26, 2021, the Philippines clinched its first gold medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, with Hidilyn Diaz winning the Women's 55 kg event in Weightlifting. Furthermore, with a 1-2-1 haul in its best Olympic showing (until 2024), the Philippines emerged as the best performing Southeast Asian nation, a title they last held coincidentally in 1964, in Tokyo and leaped to third in the all-time medal table for Southeast Asia behind Thailand and Indonesia.\nThe 2024 Summer Olympics that was held in Paris, was the Philippines' centennial anniversary of its participation in the Games, and its best showing yet, usurping its performance in the previous edition.

It has a reputation as a regional centre of excellence for the manufacturing and aerospace industries.\nThe town began to develop in the early medieval period as a number of farming hamlets surrounded by manor houses and royal forests, and has held a market for more than 700 years. During the Industrial Revolution it became one of Lancashire\'s most prominent mill towns; at its peak, it was one of the world\'s largest producers of cotton cloth and a major centre of engineering.\nBurnley has retained a strong manufacturing sector, and has strong economic links with the cities of Manchester and Leeds, as well as neighbouring towns along the M65 corridor.  In 2013, in recognition of its success, it received an Enterprising Britain award from the UK Government as the Most Enterprising Area in the UK.

It is the largest settlement in Staffordshire and is surrounded by the towns of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Alsager, Kidsgrove and Biddulph, which form a conurbation around the city.\nThe city is polycentric, formed from the federation of six towns in 1910. It took its name from the town of Stoke-upon-Trent where the main centre of government and the principal railway station in the district were located. Hanley is the primary commercial centre. The other four towns which form the city are Burslem, Tunstall, Longton and Fenton.\nThe home of the pottery industry in England, it is known as The Potteries. It is a centre for service industries and distribution centres. It formerly had a primarily heavy industry sector.\n\nHistory\nToponymy and etymology\nThe name Stoke is taken from the town of Stoke-upon-Trent, the original ancient parish, with other settlements being chapelries. Stoke derives from the Old English stoc, a word that at first meant little more than place, but which subsequently gained more specific – but divergent – connotations. These variant meanings included dairy farm, secondary or dependent place or farm, summer pasture, crossing place, meeting place and place of worship. It is unknown which of these was intended here, and all are plausible. \nThe most frequently suggested interpretations derive from a crossing point on the Roman road that ran from present-day Derby to Chesterton or the early presence of a church, said to have been founded in 670 AD. Because Stoke was such a common name for a settlement, some kind of distinguishing affix was usually added later, in this case, the name of the river.\nThe motto of Stoke-on-Trent is Vis Unita Fortior which can be translated as: United Strength is Stronger, or Strength United is the More Powerful, or A United For', ""From Walker Stapleton:\nWalker Stapleton (born April 15, 1974) is an American politician who served two terms as Colorado's state treasurer from 2011 to 2019.

He makes his debut in Chapter #247: ""Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek"", first published in Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on October 24, 1989, as the main antagonist of his eponymous saga, depicted as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.\nDespite not appearing until the manga\'s second half, Frieza is widely considered to be the most iconic and popular villain in Dragon Ball, and the archenemy of Goku – since he effectively catalyzes many of the events depicted in the story, due to the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta at his hands and Goku\'s arrival on Earth and subsequent conflicts with Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta. Frieza later appears as the primary villain in the 2015 film Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection \'F\' and as a recurring character in Dragon Ball Super.\n\nCreation and conception\nFrieza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, often rendering the planet\'s population extinct first, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the ""worst kind of people."" Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Frieza is close. Therefore, he paid special attention to how Frieza spoke; because villains typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty. The character\'s name is a pun on freezer, and because of this, his minions and the members of the Ginyu Force are named after fruits and dairy products, items one would normally put in a refrigerator.

Goku made his debut in the first Dragon Ball chapter, Bulma and Son Goku, originally published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on December 3, 1984. Goku is introduced as an eccentric, monkey-tailed boy who practices martial arts and possesses superhuman strength. He meets Bulma and joins her on a journey to find the seven wish-granting Dragon Balls. Along the way, he finds new friends who follow him on his journey to become stronger. As Goku grows up, he becomes the Earth's mightiest warrior and battles a wide variety of villains with the help of his friends and family, while also gaining new allies in the process.\nBorn under the name Kakarot, as a member of the Saiyan race on Planet Vegeta, he is sent to Earth as an infant prior to his homeworld's destruction at the hands of Frieza (ordered by Beerus). Upon his arrival on Earth, the infant is discovered by Son Gohan, who becomes the adoptive grandfather of the boy and gives him the name Goku. The boy is initially full of violence and aggression due to his Saiyan nature, until an accidental head injury turns him into a cheerful, carefree person.

Founded on December 6, 1929, by Leroy Grumman and his business partners, it merged in 1994 with Northrop Corporation to form Northrop Grumman.\n\nHistory\nLeroy Grumman worked for the Loening Aircraft Engineering Corporation beginning in 1920. In 1929, Keystone Aircraft Corporation bought Loening Aircraft and moved its operations from New York City to Bristol, Pennsylvania. Grumman and three other ex-Loening Aircraft employees, (Edmund Ward Poor, William Schwendler, and Jake Swirbul) started their own company in an old Cox-Klemin Aircraft Co. factory in Baldwin on Long Island, New York.  \nThe company registered as a business on December 6, 1929, and officially opened on January 2, 1930. While maintaining the business by welding aluminum tubing for truck frames, the company eagerly pursued contracts with the US Navy. Grumman designed the first practical floats with a retractable landing gear for the Navy, and this launched Grumman into the aviation market. The first Grumman aircraft was also for the Navy, the Grumman FF-1, a biplane with retractable landing gear developed at Curtiss Field in 1931.

Headquartered in Lisle, Illinois, IC is a wholly owned subsidiary of International Motors. Established in 2002 by Navistar through the reorganization of subsidiary manufacturer American Transportation Corporation (AmTran), IC currently produces school buses and commercial-use buses for multiple applications.\nThe IC name stands for ""Integrated Coach"", referring to how the vehicles are nearly completely assembled under a single corporate structure. For all vehicles, the body and chassis are assembled within the same manufacturing facility; the latter is designed by parent company Navistar (prior to 2015, Navistar also supplied the engine). While using a chassis and hood shared with International-brand trucks, IC Bus vehicles have separate badging.\nIC vehicles are produced at the Navistar Tulsa Bus Plant in Tulsa, Oklahoma; Prior to 2010, they were also assembled at the former AmTran/Ward facility in Conway, Arkansas.\n\nHistory\nThrough its predecessor company AmTran, IC traces its roots to 1933, founded as Ward Body Works in Conway, Arkansas.  Navistar predecessor International Harvester commenced chassis production 11 years earlier, entering production in 1922.  Following the exit of several manufacturing firms from school bus production over the previous decade, IC would be the first newly established manufacturer in the 2000s.\n\n2000s\nIn 2000, the IC name came into use for the first time, as AmTran introduced an updated version of its conventional-style bus body.  While still based upon the International 3800 and sharing much of the body with its AmTran Volunteer/CS predecessor, the new bus introduced a redesigned drivers compartment and enlarged windshield.  Named the International IC (IC standing for Integrated Coach/Chassis), the new bus emphasized how the entire vehicle was produced under the corporate entity of Navistar (who had purchased AmTran outright in 1995).

The city was founded in 1682 by William Penn, an English Quaker and advocate of religious freedom, and served as the capital of the Pennsylvania Colony during the British colonial era. The city went on to play a historic and vital role during the American Revolution and Revolutionary War, serving as the central meeting place for the nation's founding fathers, hosting the First Continental Congress in 1774, preserving the Liberty Bell, and hosting the Second Continental Congress during which the nation's 56 founders formed the Continental Army and elected George Washington as its commander in 1775, and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. For nine months, from September 1777 to June 1778, the city fell under British occupation during the war's Philadelphia campaign. In 1787, the U.S. Constitution was ratified in Philadelphia at the Philadelphia Convention. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until 1790, and it served as the nation's first capital from May 10, 1775, until December 12, 1776, and on four subsequent occasions until 1800, when construction of the new national capital in Washington, D.C. was completed.\nPhiladelphia maintains extensive contemporary influence in business and industry, culture, sports, and music.

As prime minister, she served simultaneously as First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service, and Minister for the Union.\nTruss defeated Rishi Sunak in the July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election on 5 September and was appointed prime minister the following day. Elizabeth II\'s death on 8 September caused government business to be suspended during a national mourning period of 10 days. In response to the cost-of-living crisis and energy supply crisis, the Truss ministry announced the Energy Price Guarantee, which reduced energy prices for households, businesses, and public sector organisations. Kwasi Kwarteng, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced large-scale borrowing and tax cuts in a mini-budget on 23 September. The mini-budget was widely criticised and largely reversed, having led to financial instability.\nTruss dismissed Kwarteng without explanation on 14 October and appointed Jeremy Hunt to succeed him. Suella Braverman resigned as Home Secretary on 19 October after admitting to having used her personal email address to send a Cabinet document. Her resignation letter was critical of Truss\'s government. On the evening of 19 October, MPs voted to reject a motion which would guarantee parliamentary time for a bill to ban fracking in the UK. The vote was controversial as it was unclear whether a three-line-whip had been issued to Conservative MPs, ordering them to vote against it.

', 'From Newcastle upon Tyne:\nNewcastle upon Tyne, or simply Newcastle (  new-KASS-əl, RP:   NEW-kah-səl), is a city and metropolitan borough in Tyne and Wear, England. It is England\'s northernmost metropolitan borough, located on the River Tyne\'s northern bank opposite Gateshead to the south. It is the most populous settlement in the Tyneside conurbation and North East England.\nNewcastle developed around a Roman settlement called Pons Aelius. The settlement became known as Monkchester before taking on the name of a castle built in 1080 by William the Conqueror\'s eldest son, Robert Curthose. It was one of the world\'s largest ship building and repair centres during the Industrial Revolution. Newcastle was historically part of the county of Northumberland, but governed as a county corporate after 1400. In 1974, Newcastle became part of Tyne and Wear. The local authority is Newcastle City Council, which is a constituent member of the North East Combined Authority.\n\nHistory\nRoman\nThe first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was Pons Aelius (""Hadrian\'s bridge""), a Roman fort and bridge across the River Tyne. It was given the family name of the Roman Emperor Hadrian, who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of Hadrian\'s Wall are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the ""Roman Wall"" can be traced eastwards to the Segedunum Roman fort in Wallsend – the ""wall\'s end"" – and to the separate supply fort of Arbeia in South Shields, across the river from Hadrian\'s Wall.\nThe extent of Hadrian\'s Wall was 73 miles (117 km), spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the Vallum, a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds, and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of Pictish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. Howe', 'From Timeline:\nA timeline is a list of events displayed in chronological order. It is typically a graphic design showing a long bar labelled with dates paralleling it, and usually contemporaneous events.\nTimelines can use any suitable scale representing time, suiting the subject and data; many use a linear scale, in which a unit of distance is equal to a set amount of time. This timescale is dependent on the events in the timeline. A timeline of evolution can be over millions of years, whereas a timeline for the day of the September 11 attacks can take place over minutes, and that of an explosion over milliseconds. While many timelines use a linear timescale—especially where very large or small timespans are relevant -- logarithmic timelines entail a logarithmic scale of time; some ""hurry up and wait"" chronologies are depicted with zoom lens metaphors.\nMore usually, ""timeline"" refers merely to a data set which could be displayed as described above. For example, this meaning is used in the titles of many Wikipedia articles starting ""Timeline of ...""\n\nHistory\nTime and space (particularly the line) are intertwined concepts in human thought. The line is ubiquitous in clocks in the form of a circle, time is spoken of in terms of length, intervals, a before and an after. The idea of orderly, segmented time is also represented in almanacs, calendars, charts, graphs, genealogical and evolutionary trees, where the line is central.\nOriginally, chronological events were arranged in a mostly textual form. This took form in annals, like king lists. Alongside them, the table was used like in the Greek tables of Olympiads and Roman lists of consuls and triumphs. Annals had little narrative and noted what happened to people, making no distinction between natural and human actions.\nIn Europe, from the 4th century, the dominant chronological notation was the table. This can be partially credited to Eusebius, who laid out the relations between Jewish, pagan, and Christian histories in parallel colum', 'From History:\nHistory (derived from Ancient Greek  ἱστορία (historía) \'inquiry; knowledge acquired by investigation\') is the systematic study and documentation of the human past. History is an academic discipline which uses a narrative to describe, examine, question, and analyse past events, and investigate their patterns of cause and effect. Historians debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects. Historians debate the nature of history as an end in itself, and its usefulness in giving perspective on the problems of the present.\nThe period of events before the invention of writing systems is considered prehistory. ""History"" is an umbrella term comprising past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of these events. Historians seek knowledge of the past using historical sources such as written documents, oral accounts or traditional oral histories, art and material artifacts, and ecological markers.\nStories common to a particular culture, but not supported by external sources (such as the tales surrounding King Arthur), are usually classified as cultural heritage or legends. History differs from myth in that it is supported by verifiable evidence. However, ancient cultural influences have helped create variant interpretations of the nature of history, which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today. The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation. History is taught as a part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in universities.\nHerodotus, a 5th-century BCE Greek historian, is often considered the ""father of history"", as one of the first historians in the Western tradition, though he has been criticized as the ""father of lies"".

The Old Sacramento Historic District is a U.S. National Historic Landmark District.  The Historic District is sometimes abbreviated as Old Sacramento, or Old Sac,  and since the 1960s has been restored and developed as a significant tourist attraction.\n\nHistory\nThe city of Sacramento grew up in the mid-nineteenth century as a development from Sutter's Fort.  However, the Fort was some distance from the Sacramento River, which was the main means of transport to the coast of California, and the area that would become the modern city developed along the waterfront.\nBefore Sacramento's extensive levee system was put in place, the area flooded quite regularly. Because of this, the city's streets were raised a level. Most of the sidewalks and storefronts have been filled in; however, many tunnels still remain throughout Old Sacramento and the downtown area.\nBy the 1960s, the area had fallen into disrepair and disrepute. A large effort was made to secure the area's future as an outdoor living history center similar to Colonial Williamsburg in Virginia. Several historically significant buildings were moved or reconstructed. Those that were beyond repair were demolished.\nToday, the Old Sacramento Historic District covers the area between the river frontage and Interstate 5, between I Street and the Capitol Mall. The State Historic Park comprises about a third of the total acreage of the district including half of the waterfront, a large grassy area and railroad features.  Virtually all the buildings in this area date from the 19th century, the most notable dating back to the period immediately after the disastrous fire of 1852, and show a reasonable approximation of their original appearance, though they have required varying degrees of reconstruction to restore to them to that state.

In the 1960s, Governor Pat Brown supported two large projects that reallocated water from the northern portion of the state to Southern California. In the early 1980s, his son, Governor Jerry Brown, attempted a third, the Peripheral Canal, which failed to gain voter support. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger pushed for the project in 2009 and, when Jerry Brown returned to office as governor in January 2011, he made it one of his two main focuses during his eight years in office. During those years, the project morphed from an above-the-ground ""peripheral canal"" to two huge underground tunnels referred to as the ""twin tunnels.""

It is loosely based on the first two books in The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander, a series of five novels that are in turn based on Welsh mythology.\nSet in the mythical land of Prydain during the Early Middle Ages, the film centers on a wicked emperor known as the Horned King, who hopes to secure an ancient magical cauldron that will aid him in his desire to conquer the world. He is opposed by young swineherder Taran, the young Princess Eilonwy, the harp-playing bard Fflewddur Fflam, and a friendly wild creature named Gurgi, who seek to destroy the cauldron to prevent the Horned King from ruling the world.\nThe film is directed by Ted Berman and Richard Rich, who had directed Disney's previous animated film The Fox and the Hound (1981), and was the first Disney animated film to be recorded in Dolby Stereo. Disney acquired the film rights to the books in 1973 with production beginning in 1980 to be set for a Christmas 1984 release.

India sent a contingent of six competitors including four athletes and two wrestlers with two support staff. The Indian Olympic movement was then established during the 1920s. In 1923, a provisional All India Olympic Committee was formed, and in February 1924, the All India Olympic Games (later National Games of India) were held to select a team for the 1924 Summer Olympics at Paris.

In 1889, less than a year after the death of her father, she married her third cousin Constantine, heir apparent to the Greek throne. After a difficult period of adaptation in her new country, Sophia gave birth to six children and became involved in the assistance to the poor, following in the footsteps of her mother-in-law, Queen Olga. However, it was during the wars which Greece faced during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century that Sophia showed the most social activity: she founded field hospitals, oversaw the training of Greek nurses, and treated wounded soldiers.\nHowever, Sophia was hardly rewarded for her actions, even after her grandmother Queen Victoria decorated her with the Royal Red Cross after the Thirty Days' War: the Greeks criticized her links with Germany. Her eldest brother, German Emperor William II, was indeed an ally of the Ottoman Empire and openly opposed the construction of the Megali Idea, which could establish a Greek state that would encompass all ethnic Greek-inhabited areas. During World War I, the blood ties between Sophia and the Emperor also aroused the suspicion of the Triple Entente, which criticized Constantine I for his neutrality in the conflict.\nAfter imposing a blockade of Greece and supporting the rebel government of Eleftherios Venizelos, causing the National Schism, France and its allies deposed Constantine in June 1917.

Its wider metropolitan area is the largest in Western Europe, with a population of 14.9 million. London stands on the River Thames in southeast England, at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) tidal estuary down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for nearly 2,000 years. Its ancient core and financial centre, the City of London, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and has retained its medieval boundaries. The City of Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has been the centuries-long host of the national government and parliament. London grew rapidly in the 19th century, becoming the world\'s largest city at the time. Since the 19th century, the name ""London"" has referred to the metropolis around the City of London, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which since 1965 has largely comprised the administrative area of Greater London, governed by 33 local authorities and the Greater London Authority. \nAs one of the world\'s major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on world art, entertainment, fashion, commerce, finance, education, healthcare, media, science, technology, tourism, transport, and communications. Despite a post-Brexit exodus of stock listings from the London Stock Exchange, London remains a European economic powerhouse, and one of the world\'s major financial centres. It hosts Europe\'s largest concentration of higher education institutions, some of which are the highest-ranked academic institutions in the world: Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social sciences, and the comprehensive University College London.

The Holland Tunnel, PATH mass transit system, and NY Waterway ferry service connect across the Hudson River with Manhattan. Redevelopment of the Jersey City waterfront has made the city one of the largest centers of banking and finance in the United States and has led to the district and city being nicknamed Wall Street West.

She is also known for her teaching and her rescue mission work. By the end of the 19th century, she was a household name.\nCrosby was known as the ""Queen of Gospel Song Writers"" and as the ""Mother of modern congregational singing in America"", with most American hymnals containing her work. Her gospel songs were ""paradigmatic of all revival music"", and Ira Sankey attributed the success of the Moody and Sankey evangelical campaigns largely to Crosby\'s hymns. Some of Crosby\'s best-known songs include ""Pass Me Not, O Gentle Saviour"",  ""Blessed Assurance"", ""Jesus Is Tenderly Calling You Home"", ""Praise Him, Praise Him"", ""Rescue the Perishing"", and ""To God Be the Glory"". Some publishers were hesitant to have so many hymns by one person in their hymnals, so Crosby used nearly 200 different pseudonyms during her career.\nCrosby also wrote more than 1,000 secular poems and had four books of poetry published, as well as two best-selling autobiographies.  Additionally, she co-wrote popular secular songs, as well as political and patriotic songs and at least five cantatas on biblical and patriotic themes, including The Flower Queen, the first secular cantata by an American composer.

Founded by Berry Gordy Jr.  and Quincy Jones as Tamla Records on January 12, 1959, it was incorporated as Motown Record Corporation on April 14, 1960. Its name, a portmanteau of motor and town, has become a nickname for Detroit, where the label was originally headquartered.\nMotown played a vital role in the racial integration of popular music as an African American-owned label that achieved crossover success with white audiences. In the 1960s, Motown and its subsidiary labels (including Tamla-Motown, the brand used outside the US) were the most prominent exponents of what became known as the Motown sound, a style of soul music with a mainstream pop-influenced sound and appeal. Motown was the most successful soul music label, with a net worth of $61 million. Between 1960 and 1969, Motown had 79 songs reach the top-ten of the Billboard Hot 100 .\nFollowing the events of the Detroit Riots of 1967, and the loss of key songwriting/production team Holland–Dozier–Holland that year over royalty disputes, Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles, California and it expanded into film and television production. It was an independent company until MCA Records bought it in 1988. PolyGram purchased the label from MCA in 1993, followed by MCA successor Universal Music Group, which acquired PolyGram in 1999.\nMotown spent much of the 2000s headquartered in New York City as a part of the UMG subsidiaries Universal Motown and Universal Motown Republic Group. From 2011 to 2014, it was a part of The Island Def Jam Music Group division of Universal Music. In 2014, however, UMG announced the dissolution of Island Def Jam, and Motown relocated back to Los Angeles to operate under the Capitol Music Group, now operating out of the Capitol Tower. In 2018, Motown was inducted into Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame in a ceremony held at the Charles H.

Roosevelt was James M. Cox's running mate on the Democratic Party's ticket in the 1920 U.S. presidential election, but Cox lost to Republican nominee Warren G. Harding.

As of November 2024, six different royal portraits have been used.\nAs of March 2013 there were an estimated 920 million 50p coins in circulation.

The 10-shilling note then in use was lasting only five months, and it had been suggested that a coin, which could last fifty years, would be more economical. The problem with this was that all coins are arranged in ""tiers"", each coin in a tier having the same weight-to-value ratio so that a bag of mixed coins could be weighed to ascertain the value so long as they were all bronze, all silver, etc. Each coin was identified within its tier by its size and each tier had to be capable of being identified by sight and touch. This was achieved in the then-existing sets by the use of different materials (""bronze"", ""brass"" and ""silver"") with the bronze coins having plain rims, the nickel-brass threepenny bit being 12-sided and the silver coins having milled rims. If the 10-shilling coin were to be made in the same tier as the silver coins, it would have to be twice the weight of the Crown (then and now only in use for commemorative coins) and it was generally agreed that that would make it very unpopular and expensive. It would therefore have to be in a new tier of its own.\nThe Mint could not find a suitable metal which']",Franklin Delano Roosevelt (12 years).,The context does not mention which president featured on a U.S. coin in 1972 served the longest as President of the United States of America.,0.4678049385547638,False,4,

The National Olympic Committee for Indonesia was created in 1946 and recognized in 1952. The country has never participated in the Winter Olympic Games, which can be explained by the lack of sporting facilities for winter sports on its territory.\nAs of 2024, Indonesian athletes have won a total of 40 medals, 22 in badminton, 16 in weightlifting, and 1 each in archery and sport climbing. Among countries in Southeast Asia, Indonesia ranks second behind Thailand in terms of both the number of gold medals (10) and the overall medals (40). Archers Lilies Handayani, Nurfitriyana Saiman and Kusuma Wardhani gained Indonesia's first-ever podium finish (a silver medal) in the women's team event at the 1988 Seoul Olympics. Future married couple Susi Susanti and Alan Budikusuma won the country's first two gold medals in the badminton women's and men's singles events, respectively, at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics. Barcelona 1992 was also the first Games in which Indonesia won multiple gold medals. Since then, Indonesia has won at least one gold medal at every Olympic Games, with the exception of 2012 London Olympics. \nIn badminton, Indonesia is one of the two countries, along with China, to have won gold medals in all of the sport's five disciplines at the Olympics.\nThe country's most recent gold medalist is Rizki Juniansyah, who won the 2024 men's 73 kg event in weightlifting, breaking the Clean & Jerk Olympic record in the process.

He is the drummer, co-founder, and leader of the rock band Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood, whose surname was merged with that of the group\'s bassist John ""Mac"" McVie (the only two members to appear on every studio album during the band\'s run) to form the name of the band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with Fleetwood Mac in 1998. \nBorn in Redruth, Cornwall, Fleetwood lived in Egypt and Norway for much of his childhood. Choosing to follow his musical interests, Fleetwood travelled to London at the age of 15, eventually forming the first incarnation of Fleetwood Mac with Peter Green, Jeremy Spencer and Bob Brunning. After several album releases and line-up changes, the group moved to the United States in 1974. Fleetwood then invited Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks to join. Buckingham and Nicks contributed to much of Fleetwood Mac\'s later commercial success, including the celebrated album Rumours, while Fleetwood\'s own determination to keep the band together was essential to the band\'s longevity. \nFleetwood has also enjoyed a solo career, published written works, and flirted briefly with acting.\n\nEarly life\nMichael John Kells Fleetwood was born in Redruth, Cornwall, second child to John Joseph Kells Fleetwood and Bridget Maureen (née Brereton) Fleetwood. His elder sister was actress Susan Fleetwood. In early childhood, Fleetwood and his family followed his father, a Royal Air Force fighter pilot, to Egypt. Six years later, they moved to Norway where his father was deployed by NATO. He attended school there and became fluent in Norwegian.\nBiographer Cath Carroll describes the young Fleetwood as ""a dreamer, an empathetic youth"" who, though intelligent, did not excel academically.

During the Middle Ages, more than one-quarter of Europe\'s total population was French; by the seventeenth century, this had decreased slightly to one-fifth. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, other European countries, such as Germany and Russia, had caught up with France and overtaken it in number of people. However, the country\'s population sharply increased with the baby boom following World War II. According to INSEE, since 2004, 200,000 immigrants entered the country annually. One out of two was born in Europe and one in three in Africa.

Ten years later, Puritans established Massachusetts Bay Colony north of Plymouth Colony. Over the next 126 years, people in the region fought in four French and Indian Wars until the English colonists and their Iroquois allies defeated the French and their Algonquian allies.\nIn the late 18th century, political leaders from the New England colonies initiated resistance to Britain\'s taxes without the consent of the colonists. Residents of Rhode Island captured and burned a British ship which was enforcing unpopular trade restrictions, and residents of Boston threw British tea into the harbor. Britain responded with a series of punitive laws stripping Massachusetts of self-government which the colonists called the ""Intolerable Acts"". These confrontations led to the first battles of the American Revolutionary War in 1775 and the expulsion of the British authorities from the region in spring 1776.

He was commemorated one year after his death when his surgeon brother, Dr. William Hutchinson (1909–1997), created the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, as a division of the Pacific Northwest Research Foundation. The ""Fred Hutch"", which became independent in 1975, is now one of the best-known facilities of its kind in the world.\n\nEarly years\nBorn in Seattle, Hutchinson was the youngest son of Dr. Joseph Lambert Hutchinson (1872–1951) and Nona Burke Hutchinson (1879–1962). Both were born in Wisconsin and they relocated to Seattle in 1907. A graduate of the medical school at Marquette University in Milwaukee, he was a general practitioner in the Rainier Beach area in the southeast part of Seattle. The oldest of the four Hutchinson children was daughter Mary Joy (Crosetto) (1904–1989).\nSons Bill and John were older than Fred by 10 and seven years, respectively, and both played baseball at Franklin High School and at the University of Washington in Seattle under head coach Tubby Graves. Bill captained the 1931 Huskies team which won the Pacific Coast Conference title and John (1912–1991) later played in the St. Louis Browns organization.\nThe older brothers mentored young Fred in the game and fostered a competitive spirit; they even taught him to hit left-handed to reach first base quicker. A catcher until he was 15, Hutchinson starred as a right-handed pitcher, catcher, first baseman, outfielder, and left-handed hitter at Franklin. He led the Quakers to four city championships and played American Legion ball in the summer.\n\nPitching career\nHutchinson, known throughout ba', ""From List of Manchester United F.C. managers:\nManchester United Football Club is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. The club was formed in Newton Heath in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR F.C., and played their first competitive match in October 1886, in the first round of the 1886–87 FA Cup. The club was renamed Manchester United F.C. in 1902, and moved to Old Trafford in 1910.\nFrom the beginning of the club's official managerial records in 1892 to the start of the 2024–25 season, Manchester United have had 24 full-time managers. The current manager is Ruben Amorim, who took over from interim manager Ruud van Nistelrooy on 11 November 2024.\nThe longest-serving and most successful person to manage Manchester United is Sir Alex Ferguson, who won 13 Premier League titles, five FA Cups, four League Cups, 10 Community Shields, two UEFA Champions League titles, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one Intercontinental Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup during a managerial reign of more than 26 years.\n\nManagerial history\nFrom 1878 to 1914, the team was selected by a committee whose secretary had the same powers and role as a manager has today. There were four secretaries during this period, A. H. Albut, James West, Ernest Mangnall and John Bentley.\nErnest Mangnall was the first man to bring any major silverware to the club, winning the club's first ever Football League title in 1908. This was followed by the inaugural FA Charity Shield and the club's first FA Cup the following season, and then another league title and Charity Shield in 1911. Despite this success, though, he left the club a year later to join local rivals Manchester City. Coincidentally, Mangnall's last match in charge of United was the Old Trafford derby of 7 September 1912.

He came to the major leagues as a part-time player with Pittsburgh in 1974–75, before a trade to the Astros for infielder Tommy Helms on January 6, 1976. He played all four infield positions, mostly as a third baseman and second baseman, for Houston from 1976 to 1982. While playing in only 125 games in 1977, and alternating among 2B, SS, and 3B, Howe committed just eight errors. On May 7, 1980, he suffered a fractured jaw when hit by a pitch from Expos pitcher Scott Sanderson. In the 1980 National League West tie-breaker game, he hit a home run in the third inning to increase the lead of the Astros to 4-0 against the Dodgers. He later hit a two-run single in the fourth to make it 7-0. Five innings later, the Astros won 7-1 to clinch their first division title in franchise history.\nIn May 1981 he won the Player of the Month Award, the only Astros third baseman to win it until Alex Bregman in June 2018.

It is named after its largest town, Solihull, from which Solihull Metropolitan Borough Council is based. For Eurostat purposes it is a NUTS 3 region (code UKG32) and is one of seven boroughs or unitary districts that comprise the ""West Midlands"" NUTS 2 region. Much of the large residential population in the north of the borough centres on the communities of Castle Bromwich, Kingshurst, Marston Green and Smith\'s Wood as well as the towns of Chelmsley Wood and Fordbridge. In the south are the towns of Shirley and Solihull, as well as the large villages of Knowle, Dorridge, Meriden and Balsall Common.\nSince 2011, Solihull has formed part of the Greater Birmingham & Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership along with neighbouring authorities Birmingham, Bromsgrove, Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Redditch, Tamworth and Wyre Forest.\n\nHistory\nSolihull probably derived its name from a \'miry or muddy\' or soily hill.  The parish church was built on a hill of stiff red marl, which turned to sticky mud in wet weather.\nSolihull was an ancient parish, covering the town itself and adjoining rural areas, including Shirley. Solihull was made the centre of a poor law union in 1836, covering eleven parishes: Baddesley Clinton, Balsall, Barston, Elmdon, Knowle, Lapworth, Nuthurst, Packwood, Solihull, Tanworth and Yardley. Yardley was in Worcestershire and the rest of the parishes were in Warwickshire.\nSuch poor law unions formed the basis for later local government areas. In 1872 poor law unions also became rural sanitary districts for the parts of their areas without urban authorities; there were no urban authorities in the Solihull union. In 1894 rural sanitary districts were converted into rural districts with their own elected councils under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act split districts which straddled county boundaries, and so Yardley became a separate rural d', 'From Oldbury, West Midlands:\nOldbury is a market town in the metropolitan borough of Sandwell, in the county of the West Midlands, England. It is the administrative centre of the borough. At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 13,606, while the 2017 population of the wider built-up area was estimated at 25,488. Sandwell Metropolitan Borough Council, which defines Oldbury Town as consisting of the wards of Bristnall, Langley, Oldbury, and Old Warley, gave the population as 50,641 in 2011.\n\nEtymology\nThe place name Oldbury comes from the Old English \'Ealdenbyrig\', – signifying that Oldbury was old even in early English times over 1,000 years ago. Eald being Old English for \'old\', Byrig is the plural of \'burh\' in Old English – a burh being a fortification or fortified town.\n\nHistory\nOldbury was part of the ancient parish of Halesowen, a detached part of Shropshire surrounded by Worcestershire and Staffordshire. After the dissolution of the monasteries, Henry VIII gave Hales Owen manor including Oldbury to Sir John Dudley. In 1555, Sir John\'s son Robert sold most of Hales Owen manor but retained Oldbury and Langley which became a separate manor. Thus Sir Robert Dudley became the first Lord of the Manor of Oldbury. Oldbury manor was held by several families thereafter with the land gradually being sold off and the manorial functions dispersed. The last Lord of Oldbury Manor was Patrick Allan Fraser.\nPigot and Co.\'s National Commercial Directory for 1828-9 describes Oldbury as a village in Shropshire with close trade and manufacturing links to Dudley and Stourbridge. It notes the importance of the iron trade with its ""considerable blast furnaces, for making pig iron"" and states ""there are also steel works; and coal and iron-stone abound in the vicinity"". Mention is made of a debtors\' prison, and a court-house which held a fortnightly Court of Requests for recovery of debts not exceeding five pounds.\nThe first branch of Lloyds Bank was opened in Oldbury in 1864.

It is bounded on the west by the City of Wolverhampton, the south by the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, to the south east by the City of Birmingham, and by the Staffordshire districts of Lichfield, Cannock Chase and South Staffordshire to the east, north and northwest respectively.  Most of the borough is highly industrialised and densely populated, but areas around the north and east of the borough are open space.\n\nHistory\nPrior to 1966, the area that would later become the metropolitan borough of Walsall was governed by five smaller local authorities:\n\nAldridge Urban District\nBrownhills Urban District\nDarlaston Urban District\nWalsall County Borough\nWillenhall Urban District\nThe four urban districts were all within the administrative county of Staffordshire, in a two-tier structure with Staffordshire County Council providing county-level services. Walsall itself was a self-governing county borough, independent from the county council, but was still deemed to be part of Staffordshire for ceremonial purposes.\nA review of local government in the West Midlands area was carried out under the Local Government Act 1958, culminating in the West Midlands Review Order 1965, which merged many of the districts in the area with effect from 1 April 1966. Darlaston and Willenhall were both absorbed into the county borough of Walsall, whilst the two urban districts of Brownhills and Aldridge merged to become Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District.

He was later criticized for his subsequent denial of the widespread famine (1930–1933) in the USSR, most particularly the Holodomor. Beginning in 1990, there were calls for the Pulitzer board to revoke Duranty\'s prize. The Pulitzer Board declined to revoke the award and in 2003 said the articles which it examined in making the award did not contain ""clear and convincing evidence of deliberate deception"".\n\nEarly life and career\nDuranty was born in a middle-class Merseyside family to Emmeline (née Hutchins) and William Steel Duranty. His grandparents had moved to Birkenhead, on the Wirral Peninsula in Cheshire, from the West Indies in 1842 and established a successful merchant business in which his father worked. He studied at Harrow, one of Britain\'s most prestigious public schools, but a sudden collapse in the family business led to a transfer to Bedford School. Nevertheless, he gained a scholarship to study at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a first-class degree.\nAfter completing his education, Duranty moved to Paris, where he met Aleister Crowley and participated in magic rituals with him. Duranty became involved in a relationship with Crowley\'s mistress, Jane Cheron, and eventually married her. \nIn Magick Without Tears, Crowley terms Duranty ""my old friend"" and quotes from Duranty\'s book, I Write as I Please.\nDuring World War I, Duranty worked as a reporter for The New York Times.

In 1927, the advisory board quietly instituted Pulitzer\'s word choice, replacing wholesome with whole.\nWith 1929 came the first of several much more substantive changes. The board changed the wording to ""preferably one which shall best present the whole atmosphere of American life"" and deleted the insistence that the novel portray ""the highest standard of American manners and manhood"". In 1936, emphasis was changed again, with the award going to ""a distinguished novel published during the year by an American author, preferably dealing with American life"".

The writers intended many of these characters as one-time jokes or for fulfilling needed functions in the town of Springfield, where the series primarily takes place. A number of these characters have gained expanded roles and have subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to the creator of The Simpsons, Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the Canadian sketch comedy series Second City Television.\nThis article features the recurring characters from the series outside of the five main characters (Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie Simpson). Each of them are listed in order by their first name.\n\nA\nAgnes Skinner\nAgnes Skinner (voiced by Tress MacNeille in most appearances, Maggie Roswell in ""Lisa\'s Rival"") is the mother of Principal Skinner and first appears in the first-season episode ""The Crepes of Wrath"" as an old woman who embarrassingly addresses her son as ""Spanky"". However, as episodes progress, her character turns bitter. She is very controlling of her son and often treats him as if he is a child, insulting and ridiculing him every chance she gets. She hates Edna Krabappel due to her son\'s feelings for the other woman. Agnes has been married four times and has dated Comic Book Guy and Montgomery Burns. Many Springfield residents, including the Simpsons, are afraid of her. When ""the real Seymour Skinner"" arrives in Springfield in ""The Principal and the Pauper"", Agnes ends up rejecting him, in part because he stands up to her but also because, unlike Skinner/Tamzarian, her biological son is independent and does not need her anymore, while Skinner immediately reverts to a good-for-nothing without her.\nAgnes\'s first name was revealed in the seventh-season episode ""Bart the Fink"".

The Simpsons is an animated series about a working class family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional city of Springfield, and lampoons American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition. \nThe showrunner for the sixth production season was David Mirkin who executive-produced 23 episodes. Former showrunners Al Jean and Mike Reiss produced the remaining two; they produced the two episodes with the staff of The Critic, the show they left The Simpsons to create. This was done in order to relieve some of the stress The Simpsons\' writing staff endured, as they felt that producing 25 episodes in one season was too much. The episode ""A Star Is Burns"" caused some controversy among the staff, with Matt Groening removing his name from the episode\'s credits, as he saw it as blatant advertising for The Critic, which Fox had picked up for a second season after being cancelled by ABC and with which Groening had no involvement. Fox moved The Simpsons back to its original Sunday night timeslot from season 1, having aired on Thursdays from season 2 through season 5. It has remained in this slot ever since.

As of 2024, the Aquabats' members include saxophonist Jimmy the Robot, drummer Ricky Fitness, guitarists Eaglebones Falconhawk and Chainsaw, the Prince of Karate, trumpeter Cat Boy and keyboardist Gorney.\nEasily identified by their masks and matching costumes, the Aquabats are perhaps most recognized for their comedic persona in which they claim to be crime-fighting superheroes. This theme serves as subject for much of the band's music and as part of their theatrical stage shows, which typically feature various stunts and fight scenes with costumed villains and monsters.

On a global scale, it was characterized by frequent coups, domestic conflicts and civil wars, and various political upheavals and armed conflicts which arose from or were related to decolonization, and the global struggle between NATO, the Warsaw Pact, and the Non-Aligned Movement. Many regions had periods of high-intensity conflict, notably Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.\nIn the Western world, social progressive values that began in the 1960s, such as increasing political awareness and economic liberty of women, continued to grow. In the United Kingdom, the 1979 election resulted in the victory of its Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher, the first female British Prime Minister. Industrialized countries experienced an economic recession due to an oil crisis caused by oil embargoes by the Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries. The crisis saw the first instance of stagflation which began a political and economic trend of the replacement of Keynesian economic theory with neoliberal economic theory, with the first neoliberal government coming to power with the 1973 Chilean coup d\'état.\nThe 1970s was also an era of great technological and scientific advances; since the appearance of the first commercial microprocessor, the Intel 4004 in 1971, the decade was characterised by a profound transformation of computing units – by then rudimentary, spacious machines – into the realm of portability and home accessibility.

It is the first game in Capcom's Resident Evil franchise. Set in the fictional Arklay mountain region in the Midwest, players control Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine, members of the elite task force S.T.A.R.S., who must escape a mansion infested with zombies and other monsters.\nResident Evil was conceived by the producer Tokuro Fujiwara as a remake of his 1989 horror game Sweet Home (1989). It was directed by Shinji Mikami. It went through several redesigns, first as Super NES game in 1993, then a fully 3D first-person PlayStation game in 1994 and finally a third-person game. Gameplay consists of action, exploration, puzzle solving and inventory management. Resident Evil established many conventions seen later in the series, and in other survival horror games, including the inventory system, save system, and use of a vitals-monitoring system instead of a health counter.\nResident Evil was praised for its graphics, gameplay, sound, and atmosphere, although it received some criticism for its dialogue and voice acting. It was an international best-seller, and became the highest-selling PlayStation game at the time. By December 1997, it had sold about 4 million copies worldwide and had grossed more than $200,000,000 (equivalent to $389,000,000 in 2023).\nResident Evil is often cited as one of the greatest video games ever made. It is credited with defining the survival horror genre and with returning zombies to popular culture, leading to a renewed interest in zombie films by the 2000s. It created a franchise including video games, films, comics, novels, and other merchandise. It has been ported to Sega Saturn, Windows and Nintendo DS. A sequel, Resident Evil 2, was released in 1998. In 2002, the game's remake, alongside its prequel, Resident Evil Zero, were both released for GameCube (and subsequently on other platforms) in March and November 2002, respectively.\n\nGamepla"", 'From Nemesis (Resident Evil):\nThe Nemesis, also called the Nemesis-T Type, or the Pursuer (Japanese: 追跡者, Hepburn: Tsuisekisha) in Japan, is a character in the Resident Evil survival horror video game series created by Capcom. Although smaller than other Tyrant models, the creature dwarfs a typical human, and possesses vastly superior intelligence and physical dexterity to its undead peers. It is featured in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis (1999) as a titular main villain before later emerging in other titles and cameo roles. It is also featured on various merchandise and was portrayed by Matthew G. Taylor in the 2004 film Resident Evil: Apocalypse. The character is voiced by Tony Rosato in the original game and Gregg Berger in Operation Raccoon City (2012). In the 2020 remake of Resident Evil 3, the character is voiced by David Cockman, with Neil Newbon providing the motion capture performance. Nemesis has also been featured in several other game franchises, including as a playable character in Marvel vs. Capcom and Dead by Daylight.\nTaking inspiration from the T-1000 from Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Nemesis was conceived by Shinji Mikami and Kazuhiro Aoyama as an enemy that would stalk the player throughout the game and invoke a persistent sense of paranoia. Written by Yashuhisa Kawamura to be a weapon of revenge by the Umbrella Corporation, Nemesis\'s design was drawn by artist Yoshinori Matsushita, who was instructed to create ""a rough guy who attacks with weapons and has an intimidating build"" in order to heighten the fear of being pursued. Since the Nemesis\' introduction, the character has received a positive reception and has come to be regarded as one of the series\' most popular characters, though his design and role in the Resident Evil 3 remake has been criticized. Some publications have praised its role as an intimidating villain, while others have noted it as one of their favorite and most terrifying monsters in video games.\n\nConception and creation\nIntroduced in Resident Evil 3: Nemesis, pr', 'From Resident Evil 3: Nemesis:\nResident Evil 3: Nemesis is a 1999 survival horror video game developed and published by Capcom originally for the PlayStation. It is the third game in the Resident Evil series and takes place almost concurrently with the events of Resident Evil 2. The player must control former elite agent Jill Valentine as she escapes from Raccoon City, which has been overrun by zombies. The game uses the same engine as its predecessors and features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds with fixed camera angles. Choices through the game affect how the story unfolds and which ending is achieved.\nResident Evil 3 was developed concurrently with Resident Evil – Code: Veronica and was conceived as a spin-off featuring a different protagonist. It was designed to have a more action-oriented gameplay than its predecessors and features a larger number of enemies for the player to defeat. It also introduces Nemesis, a creature that periodically pursues the player throughout the game and that was inspired by the T-1000 Terminator from the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day.\nResident Evil 3 received positive reviews and sold more than three million copies worldwide. Critics praised the detailed graphics and Nemesis as an intimidating villain, but some criticized its short length and story. In the years following its release on the PlayStation, Resident Evil 3 was ported to Windows, Dreamcast, and GameCube with varying degrees of critical success. In particular, the GameCube version was criticized for its relatively high retail price and outdated graphics. A remake, entitled Resident Evil 3, was released in 2020.\n\nGameplay\nResident Evil 3: Nemesis is a survival horror game where the player controls the protagonist, Jill Valentine, from a third-person perspective to interact with the environment and enemies.

Displaying rapid pace and composed finishing, he progressed through the Liverpool youth team and scored on his Premier League debut in May 1997, becoming the club's youngest goalscorer, at 17 years, 143 days. In his first full season in the Premier League, Owen finished as joint top scorer with 18 goals, sharing the Premier League Golden Boot. He repeated this the following year and was Liverpool's top goal-scorer from 1997 to 2004, gaining his name as a proven goal-scorer despite suffering from a recurring hamstring injury.

A concurrent Women\'s FA Cup has been held since 1970.\nThe competition is open to all eligible clubs down to level 9 of the English football league system, with level 10 clubs acting as stand-ins in the event of non-entries from above. A record 763 clubs competed in 2011–12. The tournament consists of 12 randomly drawn rounds followed by the semi-finals and the final. Entrants are not seeded, although a system of byes based on league level ensures higher ranked teams enter in later rounds – the minimum number of games needed to win, depending on which round a team enters the competition, ranges from six to fourteen.\nThe first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, and are contested by clubs in the National League System, levels 5 to 10 of the English football system, more commonly called non-League. 32 of these teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 48 professional teams from Leagues One and Two. The last entrants are the 20 Premier League and 24 Championship clubs, into the draw for the third round proper.

USP prototypes participated in rigorous testing alongside H&K\'s entry in the Offensive Handgun Weapon System (OHWS) program requested by the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM), which would later result in the Mk 23 Mod 0. The USP prototypes were then refined in 1992, based on input from the OHWS trials, and the design was finalized in December of the same year. The USP was formally introduced in January 1993 with the USP40 model (the base version) chambered for the increasingly popular .40 S&W cartridge, followed soon by the USP9 (using the 9×19mm Parabellum cartridge), and in May 1995—the USP45 (caliber .45 ACP).\nIn contrast to the P7, P9S, and VP70Z designs, the USP uses a more conventional Browning-style cam-locked action, similar to that used in the Hi-Power, but with a polymer frame.\n\nDesign details\nThe USP is a semi-automatic pistol with a mechanically locked breech using the short recoil method of operation. This rather conventional lock-up system has a large rectangular lug over the barrel\'s chamber that rides into and engages the ejection port cut-out in the slide. When a cartridge is fired, pressures generated by the ignited powder drive the cartridge casing back against the breech face on the slide, driving back both the barrel and slide as they remain locked together in the manner described above. After 3 mm (0.12 in) of unrestricted rearward travel, the projectile leaves the barrel and the gas pressures drop to a safe level.

Shooting sports may involve both team and individual competition, and team performance is usually assessed by summing the scores of the individual team members. Due to the noise of shooting and the high (and often lethal) impact energy of the projectiles, shooting sports are typically conducted at either designated permanent shooting ranges or temporary shooting fields in the area away from settlements.\n\nHistory\nGreat Britain\nThe National Rifle Association (NRA) was founded in 1859 to raise the funds for an annual national rifle meeting ""for the encouragement of Volunteer Rifle Corps and the promotion of Rifle-shooting throughout Great Britain"".\n\nUnited States\nTarget shooting was a favorite sport in colonial America, with the New England Puritans regularly testing their shooting skills for recreation and at militia training days. The Scotch Irish settlers on the frontier favored shooting matches sponsored by Tavern keepers. Turkey shoots were popular after harvest time. Contestants would pay an entry fee, and everyone who killed a tethered turkey at 110 yards for muskets or 165 yards for rifles could keep the bird.

Later, it was introduced to Japan, South Korea, and other countries; such as the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, among others.\n\nEtymology\nAccording to most common etymology, bajiquan was originally called baziquan (耙子拳; \'rake fists/boxing\') because the fists, held loosely and slightly open, are used to strike downwards in a rake-like fashion. The name was considered to be rather crude, so it was changed to bajiquan. The term baji comes from the I Ching and signifies an ""extension of all directions"". In this case, it means ""including everything"" or ""the universe"".\n\nMost people believe that Bajiquan was originally known as Bazi Quan, in which bazi\' means ""rake."" The style acquired this name because of the shape of most of the fists used. The term bazi was later changed to baji, which means ""to reach far away in all directions."" This was considered a more apt and noteworthy description of the style, because it suggests the ability to achieve great things.\nHowever, this etymology is not universally accepted.\n\nHistory\nLittle is known about the origin of the style. Information before the Republican era of China is extremely rare, with clearest documentation beginning circa 1920s-1', 'From Culture of New York City:\nNew York City has been described as the cultural capital of the world. The culture of New York is reflected in its size and ethnic diversity. As many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically diverse city in the world. Many American cultural movements first emerged in the city. Large numbers of Irish, Italian, Jewish, and eventually Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans also migrated to New York throughout the 20th century and continuing into the 21st century, significantly influencing the culture and image of New York. The city became the center of stand-up comedy in the early 20th century. The city was the top venue for jazz in the 1940s, expressionism in the 1950s and home to hip hop, punk rock, and the Beat Generation. Along with London, New York City is the global center of musical theatre, often referred to as ""Broadway"" after the major thoroughfare in Manhattan. The Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village, Lower Manhattan, is a designated U.S. National Historic Landmark and National Monument, as the site of the June 1969 Stonewall riots and the cradle of the modern gay rights movement.\nThe city is the birthplace of many cultural movements, including the Harlem Renaissance in literature and visual art; abstract expressionism (also known as the New York School) in painting; and hip hop, punk, salsa, freestyle, Tin Pan Alley, certain forms of jazz, and (along with Philadelphia) disco in music. New York has been considered the dance capital of the world. The city is also frequently the setting for novels, movies (see List of films set in New York City), and television programs. New York Fashion Week is one of the world\'s preeminent fashion events and is afforded extensive coverage by the media.\nNew York has also frequently been ranked the top fashion capital of the world on the annual list compiled by the Global Language Monitor.

As part of the Idol franchise, Australian Idol originated from the reality program Pop Idol, which was created by British entertainment executive Simon Fuller. Australian Idol was televised on Network Ten for its first seven series and was broadcast on the Southern Cross Austereo Radio Network between 2005 and 2007. The series returned in 2023 after Seven Network announced they would be picking up the show.\n\nFinalists\nSeries overview\nJudges and Hosts\nHistory\nAustralian Idol sought to discover the most commercial young singer in Australia through a series of nationwide auditions. The outcomes of the later stages of this competition were determined by public voting. It was the first show to use this system of voting in Australia. The original judging panel featured Mark Holden, Marcia Hines and Ian \'Dicko\' Dickson. In 2005, this was changed as Dickson was replaced by Kyle Sandilands.\nIn 2007, Dickson again returned to the program, when Holden left at the end of the season. In 2009, Sandilands was replaced by Jay Dee Springbett.\n\nCancellation\nNetwork Ten made the decision to ""rest"" the program for 2010 after poor ratings in 2009. No further comment was formally made regarding the future of Australian Idol on Network Ten until early 2013, following the network\'s acquisition of rights to the American series, when program chief Beverley McGarvey hinted it may return. However, later that same year, a Ten spokesperson confirmed that it would not be returning.\n\nRevival\nOn 21 October 2020, Seven Network announced at their annual upfronts that they would be reviving the series, originally slated for 2022.\nOn 28 September 2022, Seven announced that Ricki-Lee Coulter and Scott Tweedie would be the new hosts, with the judging panel consisting of former American Idol judge Harry Connick Jr., former Australian Idol judge Kyle Sandilands, Amy Sh', ""From List of Idols winners:\nA combined 273 artists have won the television series Idols, a reality singing competition adapted in forty-six regions.

The finalists are then selected amongst a group of semi-finalists by the television audiences and the judges (through wildcard rounds), with the finalist receiving the most votes by the television audiences in their weekly performance being declared the winner.\nEach winner is given a recording contract, a monetary prize, and a title as that nation's Idol, SuperStar or Star. The first winner of the format was Will Young of the United Kingdom in 2002. Two winners of the series were also able to win for another regional title: Kurt Nilsen of Norway also won World Idol in 2003, and Hady Mirza of Singapore also won Asian Idol in 2007. In addition, Jason Hartman and Sasha-Lee Davids of South Africa were the only two finalists to be declared as co-winners of the format.\nWinning the Idols series provides a unique opportunity for the winning artist(s) to launch or further their music careers, due to the surrounding publicity and the recording contract offerings. However, only a few of them have managed to further their international careers. The most notable winner of the series was Kelly Clarkson of the United States, who has sold over 70 million records worldwide.

He was born in Sucha Beskidzka, Poland, a town in Austria-Hungary at the time of his birth. His career in Hollywood spanned five decades, and he is regarded as one of the most brilliant and versatile filmmakers of Classic Hollywood cinema. He received seven Academy Awards (among 21 nominations), a BAFTA Award, the Cannes Film Festival's Palme d'Or and two Golden Globe Awards.\nWilder became a screenwriter while living in Berlin. The rise of the Nazi Party and antisemitism in Germany saw him move to Paris. He then moved to Hollywood in 1934, and had a major hit when he, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for the Academy Award-nominated film Ninotchka (1939).

He is considered one of the most melodious and skilled music directors of the Hindi film industry. He is particularly remembered for the immortal ghazals he composed for Hindi films. Some of his best works are with singers Lata Mangeshkar, Mohammed Rafi and Talat Mahmood.\n\nEarly years\nBorn on 25 June 1924, at Baghdad where his father Rai Bahadur Chunilal Kohli was working as an Accountant General with the Iraqi Police forces, Madan Mohan spent the early years of his life in the Middle East. After 1932, his family returned to their home town of Chakwal, then in Jhelum district of Punjab, British India. He was left in the care of a grandparent while his father went to Bombay to seek business opportunities. He attended local school in Lahore for the next few years. During his stay at Lahore, he learnt the basics of classical music from one Kartar Singh for a very short period, however he never received any formal training in music. Some time later, his family moved to Mumbai where he completed his Senior Cambridge from St. Mary's School in Byculla Mumbai.

He is regarded as one of the most important and influential filmmakers during the Golden Age of Hollywood, and was one of the first American directors to be recognized as an auteur. In a career of more than 50 years, he directed over 130 films between 1917 and 1970 (although most of his silent films are now lost), and received six Academy Awards including a record four wins for Best Director for The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green Was My Valley (1941), and The Quiet Man (1952).\nFord is renowned for his Westerns, such as Stagecoach (1939), My Darling Clementine (1946), Fort Apache (1948), The Searchers (1956), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962); though he worked in many other genres, including comedies, period dramas, and documentaries. He made frequent use of location shooting and wide shots, in which his characters were framed against a vast, harsh, and rugged natural terrain. He is credited with launching the careers of some of Hollywood\'s biggest stars during the 1930s, \'40s, and \'50s, including John Wayne, Henry Fonda, Maureen O\'Hara and James Stewart.\nFord\'s work was held in high regard by his contemporaries, with Akira Kurosawa, Orson Welles, Frank Capra, Andrei Tarkovsky, and Ingmar Bergman naming him one of the greatest directors of all time. Subsequent generations of directors, including many of the major figures of the New Hollywood movement, have cited his influence.

It is the home ballpark of Major League Baseball\'s Texas Rangers. It is located just south of the Rangers\' former home ballpark, Globe Life Park (originally known as The Ballpark in Arlington and renamed Choctaw Stadium after the Rangers\' departure and subsequent reconfiguration).\n\nHistory\nBackground\nOn May 20, 2016, the Rangers announced that they would vacate Globe Life Park. The new stadium was to be constructed in a public/private partnership and have a retractable roof. The ballpark was approved on the following Election Day. HKS, Inc. was announced as the architect on January 5, 2017.\nOn January 31, 2019, the Rangers announced that the playing surface of Globe Life Field would be carpeted with synthetic grass supplied by Shaw Sports Turf, making them one of only five major league teams to play their home games on artificial turf.\nThe Rangers cited weather as the reason why attendance at Globe Life Park was lower than in other baseball stadiums in major metropolitan areas, as the area is prone to high temperatures and frequent rain, and also why the venue, despite being barely two decades old, was wearing out far more quickly than ballparks of a similar age such as Jacobs Field and Coors Field. Therefore, the Rangers proposed that their new ballpark be constructed with a retractable roof. Unlike its predecessors, the new stadium\'s center field faces northeast rather than southeast.\nA new shopping mall, a Loews Hotel, and a ballpark village were planned to go along with the new stadium. After the Rangers left Globe Life Park, it was then to be renovated for football and soccer use and renamed Choctaw Stadium.\nThe plans to build the stadium generated a mixed reaction. The new stadium offers a more comfortable environment to watch baseball but extended existing taxes used to pay for AT&T Stadium.

It opened in 2000 and is the home ballpark of the Houston Astros of Major League Baseball. The ballpark has a seating capacity of 41,168, which includes 5,197 club seats and 63 luxury suites with a natural grass playing field. It was built as a replacement for the Astrodome, the first domed sports stadium ever built, which opened in 1965.\n\nHistory\nUnion Station and pre-ballpark era\nIn 1909, during the time when West End Park was Houston's premier residential area, the Houston Belt and Terminal Railway Company commissioned the design of a new union station for the city from New York City–based architects Warren and Wetmore. The location called for the demolition of several structures of Houston prominence. Horace Baldwin Rice's residence and Adath Yeshurun Congregation's synagogue among other structures were removed.\n\nWith an original estimated cost of US$1 million, Union Station was constructed by the American Construction Company for an eventual total of five times that amount.  Exterior walls were constructed of granite, limestone, and terracotta, while the interior used an extensive amount of marble. It was completed and opened on March 1, 1911. At the time, Houston, with 17 railways, was considered the main railroad hub of the Southern United States. This is also evident by the Seal of Houston, which prominently features a locomotive. Two more floors were added the following year.\nThe station served as the main inter-city passenger terminal for Houston for over seven decades thereafter. Passenger rail declined greatly after World War II, and the last regularly-scheduled train, the Lone Star, moved its service to Houston's current Amtrak station on July 31, 1974. With this move, the building became only office space for the HB&T as well as the Missouri Pacific Railroad.\nOn November 10, 1"", ""From Es Con Field Hokkaido:\nEs Con Field Hokkaido (エスコンフィールド北海道, Esukon Fīrudo Hokkaidō) is a baseball stadium located in Kitahiroshima, Hokkaido, Japan.

Designed by Obayashi Corporation and HKS Architects, the stadium has capacity for 35,000 people. It is Japan's second retractable roof facility and its asymmetrical playing surface is only the third natural turf field in NPB. The area immediately surrounding the stadium is being developed into Hokkaido Ballpark F Village, an entertainment district that holds commercial facilities and restaurants.\nThe first game was held on March 30, 2023, between the Nippon-Ham Fighters and the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, with former Nippon Ham Fighters managers Hideki Kuriyama, Masataka Nashida and Trey Hillman throwing out the first pitch to celebrate the opening of the stadium.\n\nHistory\nBackground\nIn early 2016, the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, a Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) team, began considering constructing a new stadium in or around Sapporo. Since first relocating to Sapporo from Tokyo in 2004, the Fighters played their home games in Sapporo Dome, a multi-purpose stadium. Instead of being owned and operated by the team, the facility was owned by the city of Sapporo and operated and managed by Sapporo Dome Co., Ltd., a voluntary sector company funded by the city and its community. At the time, the dome was charging the Fighters approximately ¥16 million (about $108,000) per game to play at the facility in front of a capacity crowd; annually, the team was spending around ¥1.3 billion (about $8.8 million) to play there.

The school serves a portion of Timberwood Park and Stone Oak. For the 2021-2022 school year, the school was given an ""A"" by the Texas Education Agency.\nIn 2013 Reagan was ranked fifth on Children at Risk\'s ranking of the top 10 high schools in Greater San Antonio.\n\nHistory\nSan Antonio, like many Sun Belt cities, experienced explosive growth in its suburbs beginning in the early 1990s. This growth was particularly evident in affluent areas formed by people moving to the city. In Stone Oak and Sonterra north of Route 1604 and between the Blanco Road and US-281 corridors, this rapid growth caused severe overcrowding at nearby Winston Churchill High School. At the time Churchill was the farthest-north school in the North East Independent School District, and its student population grew to 3,400 at a school designed for not more than 2,500. The district recognized this problem, and included an allocation to build a new high school in the area as a part of its 1997 bond issue. The property for the school was purchased from descendants of rancher William Classen prior to passage of the bond issue.\nAfter voters approved the bond issue, construction began on the 84-acre (340,000 m2) campus. Spaw Glass was the general contractor for the project. The name ""Ronald Reagan"" was chosen by future students of the school (those currently in attendance at other North East schools) from a list selected by the district\'s Board of Trustees. A spirit committee selected the mascot ""Rattlers"" from three finalists and chose green, silver, and black as the school colors.\nThe opening of Lady Bird Johnson High School in 2008 relieved overcrowding at Reagan as San Antonio\'s population continued booming in the early part of the 2000s.\n\nBand\nThe Ronald Reagan High School Marching Band has been in existence since ', ""From 1983 in the United States:\nEvents from the year 1983 in the United States.\n\nIncumbents\nFederal government\nPresident: Ronald Reagan (R-California)\nVice President: George H.

In 1964, she married Constantine and became queen consort of Greece. They had five children: Princess Alexia, Crown Prince Pavlos, Prince Nikolaos, Princess Theodora, and Prince Philippos. As queen, Anne-Marie spent much of her time working for a charitable foundation known as ""Her Majesty\'s Fund"", a foundation established by her mother-in-law, Queen Frederica of Greece. In 1967, Anne-Marie and her family were forced into exile upon the rise of a military dictatorship. After fleeing to Rome, they eventually settled in London, when the Greek monarchy was officially abolished.\nAnne-Marie and her family were stripped of their Greek citizenship and had their property revoked, leading them to sue in the European Court of Human Rights, where they won and were allowed back to Greece. Of the compensation she earned, Anne-Marie set up the ""Anne-Marie Foundation"", which provided assistance to people in rural areas of Greece. In 2013, she and Constantine moved back to Greece.

His long reign of 62 years is not only the longest of any Iberian monarch, but one of the longest monarchical reigns in history, ahead of Hirohito but remaining behind Queen Elizabeth II, Queen Victoria, and Ferdinand III of Naples and Sicily.\nKing James I saw the expansion of the Crown of Aragon in three directions: Languedoc to the north, the Balearic Islands to the southeast, and Valencia to the south. By a treaty with Louis IX of France, he achieved the renunciation of any possible claim of French suzerainty over the County of Barcelona and the other Catalan counties, while he renounced northward expansion and taking back the once Catalan territories in Occitania and vassal counties loyal to the County of Barcelona, lands that were lost by his father Peter II of Aragon in the Battle of Muret during the Albigensian Crusade and annexed by the Kingdom of France, and then decided to turn south. His great part in the Reconquista was similar in Mediterranean Spain to that of his contemporary Ferdinand III of Castile in Andalusia. One of the main reasons for this formal renunciation of most of the once Catalan territories in Languedoc and Occitania, and any expansion into them, is that he was raised by the Knights Templar Crusaders, who had defeated his father, who was fighting for the Pope alongside the French. It was thus effectively forbidden for him to try to maintain the traditional influence of the Count of Barcelona that previously existed in Occitania and Languedoc.\nAs a legislator and organiser, he occupies a high place among the European kings.

Aimery left only two underaged daughters as his heirs, Ermengarde and her half-sister Ermessinde (daughter of Aimery's second wife, also named Ermessinde). Aimery had at least one son, also called Aimery, attested in numerous charters, but this son predeceased him (c. 1130). Thus, the approximately five-year-old Ermengarde inherited the viscounty of Narbonne upon her father's death, which occupied a strategic place in the politics of Languedoc: it was desired by the counts of Toulouse, the counts of Barcelona, the Trencavel viscounts of Carcassonne, and the lords of Montpellier.\n\nIn 1142, Alfonso Jordan, Count of Toulouse, whose wife Faydid of Uzes had either recently died or been repudiated, attempted to married the now-adolescent Ermengarde. In reaction to this prospect, which overturned the balance of power in the region by adding Narbonne to the direct control of Toulouse, a coalition of Occitan lords led by Roger II of Béziers, viscount of Carcassonne, Béziers, Albi and Razès, formed to oppose Toulouse, and arranged the marriage of Ermengarde with a vassal of Roger II, Bernard IV of Anduze. Alfonso was defeated by the coalition and taken prisoner, and was forced to make peace with Narbonne and restore Ermengarde and her new husband to the viscounty before being released.\n\nPolitical activity\nIn 1177, Ermengarde joined Gui Guerrejat (the lover of Azalais de Porcairagues), Bernard Ato V of Nîmes and Agde, and Gui's nephews William VIII of Montpellier and Gui Burgundion, in an alliance in opposition to Raymond VI of Toulouse, whose power suddenly increased when he became ruler of Melgueil as widower of Ermessende""]",William VIII of Montpellier,The provided context does not mention a Lord of Montpellier having a child named Tortoseta.,0.5034166574478149,False,3,

It received positive reviews from critics, but grossed only $12.7 million on a $20 million budget. It was  however considered a hit regardless, due to its immediate TNT premiere ratings success, and subsequent home video sales. A prequel entitled Gods and Generals was released in 2003, also directed by Maxwell and featuring many returning cast members.\n\nPlot\nThe film begins with a narrated map showing the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, commanded by Robert E. Lee, crossing the Potomac River to invade the North in June 1863, marching across Maryland and into Pennsylvania. On June 30, Confederate spy Henry Thomas Harrison reports to Lt. Gen.

The group is overcome by paranoia and conflict as they learn that they can no longer trust each other and that any of them could be the Thing.

The Thing went through several directors and writers, each with different ideas on how to approach the story. Filming lasted roughly twelve weeks, beginning in August 1981, and took place on refrigerated sets in Los Angeles as well as in Juneau, Alaska, and Stewart, British Columbia. Of the film\'s $15 million budget, $1.5 million was spent on Rob Bottin\'s creature effects, a mixture of chemicals, food products, rubber, and mechanical parts turned by his large team into an alien capable of taking on any form.\nThe Thing was released in 1982 to negative reviews that described it as ""instant junk"" and ""a wretched excess"".

It was also the final WrestleMania to be held as a one-night event; the following year, WrestleMania was expanded to two nights.\nThe card comprised 16 matches, including four on the Kickoff pre-show.

It was held for wrestlers from the promotion\'s Raw, SmackDown, and NXT brand divisions. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the event was filmed on March 25 and 26, 2020, at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Florida and was broadcast as a two-night event on April 4 and 5. This marked the first time the event was broadcast over two nights as well as aired on tape delay. On pay-per-view, the two productions were sold as individual shows, with both available as a package deal. National Football League (NFL) player Rob Gronkowski served as the host of the event.\nThe event was originally scheduled to take place solely on April 5, 2020, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida and was to air live. In mid-March, all WWE programming was relocated to the Performance Center training facility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with no audience and only essential staff present. WrestleMania 36 was the first major professional wrestling event to be affected by the pandemic, and is in turn the only edition of WrestleMania not to feature a live crowd. Taking advantage of the format, two cinematic matches—a ""Boneyard match"" and a ""Firefly Fun House match""—were filmed offsite in an atypical, cinematic style.

The ensuing turblent aftermath sees major reductions in the workforce and cancellations of shows right and left to save money on basic residuals and music licensing costs, which lead to the end of Peak TV and a worsening condition for writers and actors that eventually led to both the 2023 Writers Guild of America strike and 2023 SAG-AFTRA strike.\n\nScripted programming\nInitial suspension of production\nThe pandemic disrupted the production of many scripted television series.

Furthermore, the Disney+ series The Falcon and the Winter Soldier suspended its international production in Prague, where filming was discontinued after a week. Filming continued in Atlanta until filming statewide was eventually suspended two weeks later.\nOn March 12, Universal Television delayed shooting for the shows Russian Doll, Rutherford Falls, and Little America.

He is typically portrayed as a dashing masked vigilante who defends the commoners and Indigenous peoples of California against corrupt, tyrannical officials and other villains. His signature all-black costume includes a cape, a hat known as a sombrero cordobés, and a mask covering the upper half of his face.\nIn the stories, Zorro has a high bounty on his head but is too skilled and cunning for the bumbling authorities to catch, and he also delights in publicly humiliating them. Because of this, the townspeople started calling him ""El Zorro"" because of his foxlike cunning and charm. Zorro is an acrobat and an expert in various weapons. Still, the one he employs most frequently is his rapier, which he often uses to carve the initial ""Z"" on his defeated foes and other objects to ""sign his work"". He is also an accomplished rider, his trusty steed being a black horse called Tornado.\nZorro is the secret identity of Don Diego de la Vega (originally Don Diego Vega), a young man who is the only son of Don Alejandro de la Vega, the wealthiest landowner in California, while Diego\'s mother is dead. In most versions, Diego learned his swordsmanship while at university in Spain and created his masked alter ego after he was unexpectedly summoned home by his father because California had fallen into the hands of an oppressive dictator. Diego is usually shown living with his father in a vast hacienda, which contains many secret passages and tunnels leading to a secret cave that serves as headquarters for Zorro\'s operations and as Tornado\'s hiding place.

Based on the 1949 novel Lisa and Lottie (published in the United Kingdom and Australia since 2014 as The Parent Trap) by Erich Kästner, the plot centers around identical twin sisters, who were separated at birth and rediscover each other while attending summer camp. The pair trade places upon returning home, and devise a plan to bring their family back together.\nThe original 1961 film received positive critical response, and was deemed a success. Starting in 1986 three television sequels were produced and released as a part of The Magical World of Disney series. The 1998 film received critical acclaim and was a hit for the studio financially.\nThe franchise will continue, with a streaming exclusive reboot in development to be released on Disney+.\n\nOrigin\nThe 1949 German children\'s picture book by Erich Kästner originally published as Das Doppelte Lottchen (The Double Lottie), was originally written during WWII as the plot for a movie. In 1942, Kästner was allowed by Nazi officials to develop the project under the working title of ""The Great Secret"", before the authorities eventually forbade his continued work. After the resolution of the war, the author redeveloped the story into the successful novel that was released.\nThe plot follows Lisa Palfy and Lottie Horn (Luise Palfy and Lottie Körner in the current British translation), two identical twins who were separated in infancy when their parents divorced while each raised by one half of the respective couple. The unsuspecting sisters meet at a summer camp where they engineer a plan to switch places when they return home. Though their behavior differs greatly, the parents do not suspect that the daughters had switched places. Upon realization the family reunites and at the behest of the daughters, the couple gets back together.\nThe book ']",Summer Magic,The context does not include the answer to your question.,0.015720291063189507,False,4,
